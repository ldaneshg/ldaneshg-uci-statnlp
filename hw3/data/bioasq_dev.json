    "\"Puffy hand syndrome\". Intravenous drug addiction is responsible for many complications, especially cutaneous and infectious. There is a syndrome, rarely observed in rheumatology, resulting in \"puffy hands\": the puffy hand syndrome. We report two cases of this condition from our rheumatologic consultation. Our two patients had intravenous drug addiction. They presented with an edema of the hands, bilateral, painless, no pitting, occurring in one of our patient during heroin intoxication, and in the other 2 years after stopping injections. In our two patients, additional investigations (biological, radiological, ultrasound) were unremarkable, which helped us, in the context, to put the diagnosis of puffy hand syndrome. The pathophysiology, still unclear, is based in part on a lymphatic toxicity of drugs and their excipients. There is no etiological treatment but elastic compression by night has improved edema of the hands in one of our patients.",
    "3,5-dimethylisoxazoles act as acetyl-lysine-mimetic bromodomain ligands. Histone-lysine acetylation is a vital chromatin post-translational modification involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene transcription. Bromodomains bind acetylated lysines, acting as readers of the histone-acetylation code. Competitive inhibitors of this interaction have antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory properties. With 57 distinct bromodomains known, the discovery of subtype-selective inhibitors of the histone-bromodomain interaction is of great importance. We have identified the 3,5-dimethylisoxazole moiety as a novel acetyl-lysine bioisostere, which displaces acetylated histone-mimicking peptides from bromodomains. Using X-ray crystallographic analysis, we have determined the interactions responsible for the activity and selectivity of 4-substituted 3,5-dimethylisoxazoles against a selection of phylogenetically diverse bromodomains. By exploiting these interactions, we have developed compound 4d, which has IC(50) values of <5 \u03bcM for the bromodomain-containing proteins BRD2(1) and BRD4(1). These compounds are promising leads for the further development of selective probes for the bromodomain and extra C-terminal domain (BET) family and CREBBP bromodomains.",
    "5-acetyl-2-arylbenzimidazoles as antiviral agents. Part 4. Within a project aimed at discovering new Flaviviridae inhibitors, new variously substituted 2-phenylbenzimidazoles were synthesized and evaluated in cell-based assays for cytotoxicity and antiviral activity against viruses representatives of the three genera of the Flaviviridae family, i.e.: Pestivirus (BVDV), Flavivirus (YFV) and Hepacivirus (HCV). Title compounds were also tested against RNA viruses representative of other single-stranded, positive-sense (ssRNA(+)) negative-sense (RNA(-)), or double-stranded (dsRNA) genomes, as well as against representatives of two DNA virus families. Nine compounds showed activity against BVDV (EC(50) = 0.8-8.0 \u03bcM), compound 31 being the most potent (EC(50) = 0.80 \u03bcM) and selective (SI = CC(50)/EC(50) = >100). When tested in an HCV replicon assay, compound 31 resulted again the most potent, displaying an EC(50) value of 1.11 \u03bcM and an SI of 100. Besides inhibiting BVDV, two compounds (35 and 38) showed a moderate activity also against YFV (EC(50) = 13 \u03bcM). Interestingly, 35 was moderately active also against RSV (EC(50) = 25 \u03bcM).",
    "A 3D map of the human genome at kilobase resolution reveals principles of chromatin looping. We use in situ Hi-C to probe the 3D architecture of genomes, constructing haploid and diploid maps of nine cell types. The densest, in human lymphoblastoid cells, contains 4.9 billion contacts, achieving 1 kb resolution. We find that genomes are partitioned into contact domains (median length, 185 kb), which are associated with distinct patterns of histone marks and segregate into six subcompartments. We identify \u223c10,000 loops. These loops frequently link promoters and enhancers, correlate with gene activation, and show conservation across cell types and species. Loop anchors typically occur at domain boundaries and bind CTCF. CTCF sites at loop anchors occur predominantly (>90%) in a convergent orientation, with the asymmetric motifs \"facing\" one another. The inactive X chromosome splits into two massive domains and contains large loops anchored at CTCF-binding repeats.",
    "A Bayesian Change point model for differential gene expression patterns of the DosR regulon of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. BACKGROUND: Low oxygen availability has been shown previously to stimulate M. tuberculosis to establish non-replicative persistence in vitro. The two component sensor/regulator dosRS is a major mediator in the transcriptional response of M. tuberculosis to hypoxia and controls a regulon of approximately 50 genes that are induced under this condition. The aim of this study was to determine whether the induction of the entire DosR regulon is triggered as a synchronous event or if induction can unfold as a cascade of events as the differential expression of subsets of genes is stimulated by different oxygen availabilities. RESULTS: A novel aspect of our work is the use of chemostat cultures of M. tuberculosis which allowed us to control environmental conditions very tightly. We exposed M. tuberculosis to a sudden drop in oxygen availability in chemostat culture and studied the transcriptional response of the organism during the transition from a high oxygen level (10% dissolved oxygen tension or DOT) to a low oxygen level (0.2% DOT) using DNA microarrays. We developed a Bayesian change point analysis method that enabled us to detect subtle shifts in the timing of gene induction. It results in probabilities of a change in gene expression at certain time points. A computational analysis of potential binding sites upstream of the DosR-controlled genes shows how the transcriptional responses of these genes are influenced by the affinity of these binding sites to DosR. Our study also indicates that a subgroup of DosR-controlled genes is regulated indirectly. CONCLUSION: The majority of the dosR-dependent genes were up-regulated at 0.2% DOT, which confirms previous findings that these genes are triggered by hypoxic environments. However, our change point analysis also highlights genes which were up-regulated earlier at levels of about 8% DOT indicating that they respond to small fluctuations in oxygen availability. Our analysis shows that there are pairs of divergent genes where one gene in the pair is up-regulated before the other, presumably for a flexible response to a constantly changing environment in the host.",
    "A TrkB small molecule partial agonist rescues TrkB phosphorylation deficits and improves respiratory function in a mouse model of Rett syndrome. Rett syndrome (RTT) results from loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) and is characterized by abnormal motor, respiratory and autonomic control, cognitive impairment, autistic-like behaviors and increased risk of seizures. RTT patients and Mecp2-null mice exhibit reduced expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which has been linked in mice to increased respiratory frequency, a hallmark of RTT. The present study was undertaken to test the hypotheses that BDNF deficits in Mecp2 mutants are associated with reduced activation of the BDNF receptor, TrkB, and that pharmacologic activation of TrkB would improve respiratory function. We characterized BDNF protein expression, TrkB activation and respiration in heterozygous female Mecp2 mutant mice (Het), a model that recapitulates the somatic mosaicism for mutant MECP2 found in typical RTT patients, and evaluated the ability of a small molecule TrkB agonist, LM22A-4, to ameliorate biochemical and functional abnormalities in these animals. We found that Het mice exhibit (1) reduced BDNF expression and TrkB activation in the medulla and pons and (2) breathing dysfunction, characterized by increased frequency due to periods of tachypnea, and increased apneas, as in RTT patients. Treatment of Het mice with LM22A-4 for 4 weeks rescued wild-type levels of TrkB phosphorylation in the medulla and pons and restored wild-type breathing frequency. These data provide new insight into the role of BDNF signaling deficits in the pathophysiology of RTT and highlight TrkB as a possible therapeutic target in this disease.",
    "A Whole-Genome Analysis Framework for Effective Identification of Pathogenic Regulatory Variants in Mendelian Disease. The interpretation of non-coding variants still constitutes a major challenge in the application of whole-genome sequencing in Mendelian disease, especially for single-nucleotide and other small non-coding variants. Here we present Genomiser, an analysis framework that is able not only to score the relevance of variation in the non-coding genome, but also to associate regulatory variants to specific Mendelian diseases. Genomiser scores variants through either existing methods such as CADD or a bespoke machine learning method and combines these with allele frequency, regulatory sequences, chromosomal topological domains, and phenotypic relevance to\u00a0discover variants associated to specific Mendelian disorders. Overall, Genomiser is able to identify causal regulatory variants as the\u00a0top candidate in 77% of simulated whole genomes, allowing effective detection and discovery of regulatory variants in Mendelian disease.",
    "A case of Mowat-Wilson syndrome caused by a truncating mutation within exon 8 of the ZEB2 gene. Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is characterized by severe mental retardation with seizures, specific facial dysmorphism, Hirschsprung disease, anomalies of the corpus callosum, and genitourinary and cardiac malformations. The cause of MWS is a de novo mutation in the ZEB2 gene. This report describes a Turkish boy who was clinically diagnosed with MWS and had his diagnosis confirmed by molecular analysis of the ZEB2 gene. The investigation identified a heterozygous complex rearrangement in exon 8 of ZEB2, specifically a 48-nucleotide deletion and a 44-nucleotide insertion that caused a frameshift. MWS is a relatively newly identified disorder, and even MWS patients without Hirschsprung disease can be diagnosed easily based on clinical findings alone.",
    "A frameshift mutation in the LYST gene is responsible for the Aleutian color and the associated Ch\u00e9diak-Higashi syndrome in American mink. One of the colors of mink is Aleutian (aa)-a specific gun-metal gray pigmentation of the fur-commonly used in combination with other color loci to generate popular colors such as Violet (aammpp) and Sapphire (aapp). The Aleutian color allele is a manifestation of mink Ch\u00e9diak-Higashi syndrome (CHS), which has been described in humans and several other species. As with forms of CHS in other species, we report that the mink CHS is linked to the lysosomal trafficking regulator ( LYST ) gene. Furthermore, we have identified a base deletion (c.9468delC) in exon 40 of LYST, which causes a frameshift and virtually terminates the LYST product prematurely (p.Leu3156Phefs*37). We investigated the blood parameters of three wild-type mink and three CHS mink. No difference in the platelet number between the two groups was observed, but an accumulation of platelets between the groups appears different when collagen is used as a coagulant. Microscopic analysis of peripheral blood indicates giant inclusions in the neutrophils of the Aleutian mink types. Molecular findings at the LYST locus enable the development of genetic tests for analyzing the color selection in American mink.",
    "A human polymorphism of protein phosphatase-1 inhibitor-1 is associated with attenuated contractile response of cardiomyocytes to beta-adrenergic stimulation. Aberrant beta-adrenergic signaling and depressed calcium homeostasis, associated with an imbalance of protein kinase A and phosphatase-1 activities, are hallmarks of heart failure. Phosphatase-1 is restrained by its endogenous inhibitor, protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 (PPI-1). We assessed 352 normal subjects, along with 959 patients with heart failure and identified a polymorphism in PPI-1 (G147D) exclusively in black subjects. To determine whether the G147D variant could affect cardiac function, we infected adult cardiomyocytes with adenoviruses expressing D147 or wild-type (G147) PPI-1. Under basal conditions, there were no significant differences in fractional shortening or contraction or relaxation rates. However, the enhancement of contractile parameters after isoproterenol stimulation was significantly blunted in D147 compared with G147 and control myocytes. Similar findings were observed in calcium kinetics. The attenuated beta-agonist response was associated with decreased (50%) phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN) at serine 16, whereas phosphorylation of troponin I and ryanodine receptor was unaltered. These findings suggest that the human G147D PPI-1 can attenuate responses of cardiomyocytes to beta-adrenergic agonists by decreasing PLN phosphorylation and therefore may contribute to deteriorated function in heart failure.",
    "A meta-analysis of prospective randomized controlled trials evaluating endovascular therapies for acute ischemic stroke. INTRODUCTION: A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT), the Multicenter Randomized CLinical trial of Endovascular treatment for Acute ischemic stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN), demonstrated better outcomes with endovascular treatment compared with medical therapy for acute ischemic stroke (AIS). However, previous trials have provided mixed results regarding the efficacy of endovascular treatment for AIS. A meta-analysis of all available trial data was performed to summarize the available evidence. METHODS: A literature search was performed to identify all prospective RCTs comparing endovascular therapies with medical management for AIS. Two datasets were created: (1) all patients randomized after confirmation of large vessel occlusion (LVO) (consistent with the contemporary standard of practice at the majority of centers); and (2) all patients with outcome data who underwent randomization regardless of qualifying vascular imaging. The pre-specified primary outcome measure was modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 90 days. A fixed-effect model was used to determine significance. RESULTS: Five prospective RCTs comparing endovascular therapies with medical management were included in dataset 1 (1183 patients) and six were included in dataset 2 (1903 total patients). Endovascular therapies were associated with significantly improved outcomes compared with medical management (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.16, p=0.0001) for patients with LVO (dataset 1). This benefit persisted when patients from all six RCTs were included, even in the absence of confirmation of LVO (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.54, p=0.019; dataset 2). CONCLUSIONS: A meta-analysis of prospective RCTs comparing endovascular therapies with medical management demonstrates superior outcomes in patients randomized to endovascular therapy.",
    "A monoclonal antibody based capture ELISA for botulinum neurotoxin serotype B: toxin detection in food. Botulism is a serious foodborne neuroparalytic disease, caused by botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), produced by the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium botulinum. Seven toxin serotypes (A-H) have been described. The majority of human cases of botulism are caused by serotypes A and B followed by E and F. We report here a group of serotype B specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) capable of binding toxin under physiological conditions. Thus, they serve as capture antibodies for a sandwich (capture) ELISA. The antibodies were generated using recombinant peptide fragments corresponding to the receptor-binding domain of the toxin heavy chain as immunogen. Their binding properties suggest that they bind a complex epitope with dissociation constants (KD's) for individual antibodies ranging from 10 to 48 \u00d7 10-11 M. Assay performance for all possible combinations of capture-detector antibody pairs was evaluated and the antibody pair resulting in the lowest level of detection (L.O.D.), ~20 pg/mL was determined. Toxin was detected in spiked dairy samples with good recoveries at concentrations as low as 0.5 pg/mL and in ground beef samples at levels as low as 2 ng/g. Thus, the sandwich ELISA described here uses mAb for both the capture and detector antibodies (binding different epitopes on the toxin molecule) and readily detects toxin in those food samples tested.",
    "A new era of treatment for patients with haemophilia A? Treatment and prevention of bleeding episodes in patients with severe haemophilia A require frequent intravenous injection of factor VIII. Inhibitory antibodies against factor VIII occur in approximately 30 % of these patients during the first exposure days and immune tolerance induction to eradicate the inhibitor is challenging. Prevention of bleeds in patients with haemophilia A and inhibitors is less effective and there is ongoing research for alternative treatment options. A promising approach in 2016 is the development of emicizumab (ACE910), a bi-specific IgG antibody to factor IXa and factor X, that mimics the cofactor function of factor VIII. Due to the different structure of this antibody it cannot be neutralized by factor VIII inhibitors and has the possibility to achieve haemostasis in patients with severe haemophilia A with and without inhibitors. First studies in healthy volunteers and in patients showed a shortened activated partial thromboplastin time and increased peak height of thrombin generation in a dose-dependent manner. The half-life of the drug was 4 to 5 weeks. There were no clinical signs of thrombosis and no laboratory abnormalities indicating hypercoagulability. In a first study with 18 patients with severe haemophilia A with and without inhibitors a remarkable reduction in the annualised bleeding rate occurred. Safety of the drug has to be proven in ongoing research. Mimicking the cofactor activity of factor VIII by a bispecific antibody for the treatment of severe haemophilia A is so far safe and seems to be effective and is one highlight in haemostasis 2016.",
    "A novel and functional variant within the ATG5 gene promoter in sporadic Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Majority of PD are sporadic, for which genetic causes remain largely unknown. Alpha-synuclein, the main component of Lewy bodies, plays a central role in the PD pathogenesis. Macroautophagy is a highly conserved cellular process that digests dysfunctional macromolecules and damaged organelles. Accumulating evidence indicates that macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is involved in alpha-synuclein degradation. Dysregulation of autophagy has been observed in the brain tissues from PD patients and animal models. We hypothesized that change expression levels of autophagy-related genes (ATG), including ATG5, may contribute to PD. In this study, we genetically and functionally analyzed the ATG5 gene promoter in groups of sporadic PD patients and ethnic-matched healthy controls. A novel heterozygous variant, 106774459T>A, was identified in one female patient, but in none of controls, which significantly enhanced transcriptional activities of the ATG5 gene promoter. Furthermore, ATG5 gene expression level in the PD patient was significantly elevated than that in controls. Four novel heterozygous variants, 106774423C>A, 106774418C>A, 106774382C>A and 106774206G>A, were only found in controls. The variant, 106774464C>T, and SNP-106774030A>G (rs510432) were found in PD patients and controls with similar frequencies. Collectively, the variant identified in PD patient may change ATG5 protein levels and alter autophagy activities, contributing to PD onset as a risk factor.",
    "A novel early onset lethal form of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia maps to chromosome 7p14-p22. INTRODUCTION: Previously, autosomal dominant catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT [1]) was mapped to chromosome 1q42-43 with identification of pathogenic mutations in RYR2. Autosomal recessive CPVT (2) was mapped to chromosome 1p13-21, leading to the identification of mutations in CASQ2. In this study, we aimed to elucidate clinical phenotypes of a new variant of CPVT (3) in an inbred Arab family and also delineate the chromosomal location of the gene causing CPVT (3). METHODS AND RESULTS: In a highly inbred family, clinical symptoms of CPVT appeared early in childhood (7-12 years) and in three of the four cases, the first appearance of symptoms turned into a fatal outcome. Parents of the affected children were first-degree cousins and without any symptoms. Segregation analysis suggested an autosomal recessive inheritance. A genome-wide search using polymorphic DNA markers mapped the disease locus to a 25-Mb interval on chromosome 7p14-p22. A maximal multipoint LOD score of 3.17 was obtained at marker D7S493. Sequencing of putative candidate genes, SP4, NPY, FKBP9, FKBP14, PDE1C, and TBX20, in and around this locus, did not reveal any mutation. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a novel highly malignant autosomal recessive form of CPVT and mapped this disorder to a 25-Mb interval on chromosome 7p14-p22.",
    "A novel mutation ApoE2 Kurashiki (R158P) in a patient with lipoprotein glomerulopathy. Lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG) is a rare glomerulopathy caused by lipoprotein thrombi. In almost all cases of LPG, several apolipoprotein (apo) E mutations were reported. Here, we present a case of LPG caused by a novel mutation that we named ApoE2 Kurashiki, which substitutes arginine with proline at apoE codon 158. ApoE2 polymorphism is well known for its relationship to type III hyperlipoproteinemia, and the common apoE2 isoform is encoded by the R158C allele. ApoE2 Kurashiki substitutes at the same codon and cannot be distinguished from common apoE2 by stan-dard apoE genotyping or phenotyping.",
    "A novel mutation in the endosomal Na+/H+ exchanger NHE6 (SLC9A6) causes Christianson syndrome with electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep (ESES). Mutations in the solute carrier family 9, subfamily A member 6 (SLC9A6) gene, encoding the endosomal Na+/H+ exchanger 6 (NHE6) are associated with Christianson syndrome, a syndromic form of X-linked intellectual disability characterized by microcephaly, severe global developmental delay, autistic behavior, early onset seizures and ataxia. In a 7-year-old boy with characteristic clinical and neuroimaging features of Christianson syndrome and epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spikes and waves during sleep, we identified a novel splice site mutation (IVS10-1G>A) in SLC9A6. These findings expand the clinical spectrum of the syndrome and indicate NHE6 dysfunction as a new cause of electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep (ESES).",
    "A randomized controlled study of 5 and 10\u00a0days treatment with phenoxymethylpenicillin for pharyngotonsillitis caused by streptococcus group A - a protocol study. BACKGROUND: In 2014 the Swedish government assigned to The Public Health Agency of Sweden to conduct studies to evaluate optimal use of existing antibiotic agents. The aim is to optimize drug use and dosing regimens to improve the clinical efficacy. The present study was selected following a structured prioritizing process by independent experts. METHODS: This phase IV study is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study with non-inferiority design regarding the therapeutic use of penicillin V with two parallel groups. The overall aim is to study if the total exposure with penicillin V can be reduced from 1000\u00a0mg three times daily for 10\u00a0days to 800\u00a0mg four times daily for 5\u00a0days when treating Streptococcus pyogenes (Lancefield group A) pharyngotonsillitis. Patients will be recruited from 17 primary health care centers in Sweden. Adult men and women, youth and children > 6\u00a0years of age who consult for sore throat and is judged to have a pharyngotonsillitis, with 3-4 Centor criteria and a positive rapid test for group A streptococci, will be included in the study. The primary outcome is clinical cure 5-7 days after discontinuation of antibiotic treatment. Follow-up controls will be done by telephone after 1 and 3 months. Throat symptoms, potential relapses and complications will be monitored, as well as adverse events. Patients (n = 432) will be included during 2\u00a0years. DISCUSSION: In the era of increasing antimicrobial resistance and the shortage of new antimicrobial agents it is necessary to revisit optimal usage of old antibiotics. Old antimicrobial drugs are often associated with inadequate knowledge on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and lack of optimized dosing regimens based on randomized controlled clinical trials. If a shorter and more potent treatment regimen is shown to be equivalent with the normal 10\u00a0day regimen this can imply great advantages for both patients (adherence, adverse events, resistance) and the community (resistance, drug costs). TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT number 2015-001752-30 . Protocol FoHM/Tonsillit2015 date 22 June 2015, version 2.

    "A structural mechanism for calcium transporter headpiece closure. To characterize the conformational dynamics of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium pump (SERCA) we performed molecular dynamics simulations beginning with several different high-resolution structures. We quantified differences in structural disorder and dynamics for an open conformation of SERCA versus closed structures and observed that dynamic motions of SERCA cytoplasmic domains decreased with decreasing domain-domain separation distance. The results are useful for interpretation of recent intramolecular F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) distance measurements obtained for SERCA fused to fluorescent protein tags. Those previous physical measurements revealed several discrete structural substates and suggested open conformations of SERCA are more dynamic than compact conformations. The present simulations support this hypothesis and provide additional details of SERCA molecular mechanisms. Specifically, all-atoms simulations revealed large-scale translational and rotational motions of the SERCA N-domain relative to the A- and P-domains during the transition from an open to a closed headpiece conformation over the course of a 400 ns trajectory. The open-to-closed structural transition was accompanied by a disorder-to-order transition mediated by an initial interaction of an N-domain loop (N\u03b25-\u03b26, residues 426-436) with residues 133-139 of the A-domain. Mutation of three negatively charged N-domain loop residues abolished the disorder-to-order transition and prevented the initial domain-domain interaction and subsequent closure of the cytoplasmic headpiece. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations were in harmony with all-atoms simulations and physical measurements and revealed a close communication between fluorescent protein tags and the domain to which they were fused. The data indicate that previous intramolecular FRET distance measurements report SERCA structure changes with high fidelity and suggest a structural mechanism that facilitates the closure of the SERCA cytoplasmic headpiece.",
    "A transcription-independent role for TFIIB in gene looping. Recent studies demonstrated the existence of gene loops that juxtapose the promoter and terminator regions of genes with exceptionally long ORFs in yeast. Here we report that looping is not idiosyncratic to long genes but occurs between the distal ends of genes with ORFs as short as 1 kb. Moreover, looping is dependent upon the general transcription factor TFIIB: the E62K (glutamic acid 62 --> lysine) form of TFIIB adversely affects looping at every gene tested, including BLM10, SAC3, GAL10, SEN1, and HEM3. TFIIB crosslinks to both the promoter and terminator regions of the PMA1 and BLM10 genes, and its association with the terminator, but not the promoter, is adversely affected by E62K and by depletion of the Ssu72 component of the CPF 3' end processing complex, and is independent of TBP. We propose a model suggesting that TFIIB binds RNAP II at the terminator, which in turn associates with the promoter scaffold.",
    "A transgenic mouse model demonstrates a dominant negative effect of a point mutation in the RPS19 gene associated with Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA) is an inherited erythroblastopenia associated with mutations in at least 8 different ribosomal protein genes. Mutations in the gene encoding ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) have been identified in approximately 25% of DBA families. Most of these mutations disrupt either the translation or stability of the RPS19 protein and are predicted to cause DBA by haploinsufficiency. However, approximately 30% of RPS19 mutations are missense mutations that do not alter the stability of the RPS19 protein and are hypothesized to act by a dominant negative mechanism. To formally test this hypothesis, we generated a transgenic mouse model expressing an RPS19 mutation in which an arginine residue is replaced with a tryptophan residue at codon 62 (RPS19R62W). Constitutive expression of RPS19R62W in developing mice was lethal. Conditional expression of RPS19R62W resulted in growth retardation, a mild anemia with reduced numbers of erythroid progenitors, and significant inhibition of terminal erythroid maturation, similar to DBA. RNA profiling demonstrated more than 700 dysregulated genes belonging to the same pathways that are disrupted in RNA profiles of DBA patient cells. We conclude that RPS19R62W is a dominant negative DBA mutation.",
    "ALK: a tyrosine kinase target for cancer therapy. The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene plays an important physiologic role in the development of the brain and can be oncogenically altered in several malignancies, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL). Most prevalent ALK alterations are chromosomal rearrangements resulting in fusion genes, as seen in ALCL and NSCLC. In other tumors, ALK copy-number gains and activating ALK mutations have been described. Dramatic and often prolonged responses are seen in patients with ALK alterations when treated with ALK inhibitors. Three of these-crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib-are now FDA approved for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC positive for ALK fusions. However, the emergence of resistance is universal. Newer ALK inhibitors and other targeting strategies are being developed to counteract the newly emergent mechanism(s) of ALK inhibitor resistance. This review outlines the recent developments in our understanding and treatment of tumors with ALK alterations.",
    "APOBEC3B and AID have similar nuclear import mechanisms. Members of the APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like) protein family catalyze DNA cytosine deamination and underpin a variety of immune defenses. For instance, several family members, including APOBEC3B (A3B), elicit strong retrotransposon and retrovirus restriction activities. However, unlike the other proteins, A3B is the only family member with steady-state nuclear localization. Here, we show that A3B nuclear import is an active process requiring at least one amino acid (Val54) within an N-terminal motif analogous to the nuclear localization determinant of the antibody gene diversification enzyme AID (activation-induced cytosine deaminase). Mechanistic conservation with AID is further suggested by A3B's capacity to interact with the same subset of importin proteins. Despite these mechanistic similarities, enforced A3B expression cannot substitute for AID-dependent antibody gene diversification by class switch recombination. Regulatory differences between A3B and AID are also visible during cell cycle progression. Our studies suggest that the present-day A3B enzyme retained the nuclear import mechanism of an ancestral AID protein during the expansion of the APOBEC3 locus in primates. Our studies also highlight the likelihood that, after nuclear import, specialized mechanisms exist to guide these enzymes to their respective physiological substrates and prevent gratuitous chromosomal DNA damage.",
    "Aberrant nestin expression during ethylnitrosourea-(ENU)-induced neurocarcinogenesis. Nestin is a unique intermediate filament protein. While it is robustly expressed in developing brain, postnatal expression is limited to the brain's subventricular zone (SVZ) and endothelial cells. Reexpression occurs, however, under several pathological conditions, including injury and neoplasia. We hypothesized that nestin would be a sensitive marker of early neoplasia after transplacental exposure of rats to ethylnitrosourea (ENU). Rats of various ages were administered bromodeoxyuridine (BudR) before sacrifice, and brain sections were examined for proliferative cells and several immunohistochemical markers, including nestin. Additional rats were examined after a stab wound injury to assess the expression of two of these markers, GFAP and nestin, in reactive astrocytes. All ENU-induced brain tumors (n = 9) were classified as gliomas (astrocytomas or oligoastrocytomas) based on their histology and immunophenotype. Nestin expression was noted in all tumors examined and was present in tumor cells as well as endothelial cells. During tumor development, we consistently noted nestin-expressing cells bearing multiple processes distributed throughout brain parenchyma. Both single cells and multiple cell clusters were observed as early as postnatal day 30 in all ENU-exposed brains examined (n = 11). Such distinctive nestin-expressing cells were not seen in nestin-stained control brains or ENU-exposed brains stained for GFAP or vimentin, nor was such a cell seen in a stab wound model used to assess reactive astrocytosis. While the number of these clusters was highly variable among rats, their size increased between 30 and 90 days. The data suggest that these nestin-expressing cells represent an early stage of the neoplastic process. It remains to be determined whether these cells become apparent at 30 days of age due to \"dedifferentiation\" of a local resident astrocyte or astrocyte precursor cell or migration of a relatively undifferentiated precursor/stem cell from the SVZ.",
    "Accelerated growth in the absence of DNA replication origins. DNA replication initiates at defined sites called origins, which serve as binding sites for initiator proteins that recruit the replicative machinery. Origins differ in number and structure across the three domains of life and their properties determine the dynamics of chromosome replication. Bacteria and some archaea replicate from single origins, whereas most archaea and all eukaryotes replicate using multiple origins. Initiation mechanisms that rely on homologous recombination operate in some viruses. Here we show that such mechanisms also operate in archaea. We use deep sequencing to study replication in Haloferax volcanii and identify four chromosomal origins of differing activity. Deletion of individual origins results in perturbed replication dynamics and reduced growth. However, a strain lacking all origins has no apparent defects and grows significantly faster than wild type. Origin-less cells initiate replication at dispersed sites rather than at discrete origins and have an absolute requirement for the recombinase RadA, unlike strains lacking individual origins. Our results demonstrate that homologous recombination alone can efficiently initiate the replication of an entire cellular genome. This raises the question of what purpose replication origins serve and why they have evolved.",
    "Acrokeratosis paraneoplastica (Bazex syndrome): report of a case associated with small cell lung carcinoma and review of the literature. Acrokeratosis paraneoplastic (Bazex syndrome) is a rare, but distinctive paraneoplastic dermatosis characterized by erythematosquamous lesions located at the acral sites and is most commonly associated with carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract. We report a 58-year-old female with a history of a pigmented rash on her extremities, thick keratotic plaques on her hands, and brittle nails. Chest imaging revealed a right upper lobe mass that was proven to be small cell lung carcinoma. While Bazex syndrome has been described in the dermatology literature, it is also important for the radiologist to be aware of this entity and its common presentations.",
    "Active surveillance of sudden cardiac death in young athletes by periodic Internet searches. The authors hypothesized that prospective, systematic Internet searches could identify occurrences of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in athletes and would be useful for establishing a system of active surveillance. Weekly advanced Google searches of the Internet were conducted for cases of SCD in young athletes during a 12-month period (2007-2008). Athletes ages 11-30 years who collapsed during a game, practice, or within an hour of exercise were included in the study. Individuals with known histories of cardiac issues and events occurring outside the United States were excluded. Verification of SCD was by autopsy reports and death certificates from county coroner offices and vital record agencies. Initially, 71 events were identified. Verification for the cause of death by coroner reports was possible in 45 cases, 43 (96 %) of which were confirmed to be SCDs. A total of 69 individuals 11-30 years of age (mean 17 \u00b1 5 years) died suddenly of cardiovascular causes while participating in 15 different organized sports and a variety of nonorganized physical activities. The most common cause of death was hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (30 %), followed by coronary artery anomalies (9 %), and myocarditis (9 %). The incidence of athlete SCD, the types of sports involved, and the cardiac causes of death in our study were comparable with those of previous reports. Readily available Internet searches have the potential to be a powerful tool for identifying occurrences of athlete SCD. An active surveillance system using Google searches followed by coroner report verification can provide important epidemiologic and clinical information.",
    "Acute coronary syndromes: targeting inflammation-what has the VISTA-16 trial taught us? The VISTA-16 trial of varespladib, a secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) inhibitor, in patients with an acute coronary syndrome was terminated prematurely owing to futility and a signal towards harm. Despite these discouraging results, therapies that target inflammation to modify pathways in atherogenesis remain an area of active investigation.",
    "Additional phenotypic features of Muenke syndrome in 2 Dutch families. In about 30% of the patients with syndromal craniosynostosis, a genetic mutation can be traced. For the purpose of adequate genetic counseling and treatment of these patients, the full spectrum of clinical findings for each specific mutation needs to be appreciated. The Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene is found in patients with Muenke syndrome and is one of the most frequently encountered mutations in craniosynostosis syndromes. A number of studies on the relationship between genotype and phenotype concerning this specific mutation have been published. Two Dutch families with Muenke syndrome were screened for the reported characteristics of this syndrome and for additional features. New phenotypical findings were hypoplasia of the frontal sinus, ptosis of the upper eyelids, dysplastic elbow joints with restricted elbow motion, and mild cutaneous syndactyly. Incidentally, polydactyly, severe ankylosis of the elbow, fusion of cervical vertebrae, and epilepsy were found. Upper eyelid ptosis is thought to be pathognomonic for Saethre-Chotzen syndrome but was also observed in our series of patients with Muenke syndrome. Because Muenke and Saethre-Chotzen syndrome can have similar phenotypes, DNA analysis is needed to distinguish between these syndromes, even when a syndrome diagnosis is already made in a family member.",
    "Alteration in composition of keratin intermediate filaments in a model of breast cancer progression and the potential to reverse hallmarks of metastasis. BACKGROUND: In breast cancer the development of metastasis is a major turning point in the treatment and outcome of the disease. Throughout tumour development, and especially in the development of metastasis, epithelial mesenchymal transition takes place. During this transformation into a mesenchymal phenotype, the tumour cells undergo a series of structural changes. The loss of structural integrity and adoption of mesenchymal filaments enables cells to detach from the epithelial cell layer and metastasise. Keratins form the intermediate filaments of the cytoskeleton and provide scaffold structures within cells. During cancer progression the intermediate filaments are reorganised, and dramatic changes are seen in their protein components. Keratins K8, K18, K19 and vimentin are intermediate filament proteins with altered expression profiles during tumour development. METHOD: We have used in vivo and in vitro models to analyse changes in intermediate filament proteins. Antibody-based methods were used to study K8 levels and proteomic analysis to profile the protein content of metastatic breast cancer cell variants. RESULTS: K8 expression declines as human breast tumours progress into an invasive phenotype. Analysis of IF proteins indicated altered expression profiles of K8, K18, K19 and vimentin, with K8, K18, K19 expressed in high levels in the T47D and MCF-7 cell lines, whereas the highly metastatic cell lines expressed lower levels of K8 and K18 and no detectable K19. Vimentin showed reverse expression profile with T47D and MCF-7 cells having no detectable vimentin expression whereas the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 showed high levels. Analysis of acetylation status using specific antibodies suggested acetylation occurred within the central coiled domain in the MCF-7 and T47D cells. Inhibition of tumour growth by tissue factor (TF) shRNA resulted in a dramatic re-elevation of expression of K8 in xenographs of the highly metastatic MDA-MB-436 line. CONCLUSION: Intermediate filament expression alters during epithelial mesenchymal transition. Identified post translational modifications may play a role in alterations seen in the organisation, solubility and stability of these filaments. Epithelial mesenchymal transition can be reversed and an epithelial phenotype re-established.",
    "Altered gene products involved in the malignant reprogramming of cancer stem/progenitor cells and multitargeted therapies. Recent studies in the field of cancer stem cells have revealed that the alterations in key gene products involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program, altered metabolic pathways such as enhanced glycolysis, lipogenesis and/or autophagy and treatment resistance may occur in cancer stem/progenitor cells and their progenies during cancer progression. Particularly, the sustained activation of diverse developmental cascades such as hedgehog, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, Notch, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)/TGF-\u03b2R receptors and/or stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)/CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) can play critical functions for high self-renewal potential, survival, invasion and metastases of cancer stem/progenitor cells and their progenies. It has also been observed that cancer cells may be reprogrammed to re-express different pluripotency-associated stem cell-like markers such as Myc, Oct-3/4, Nanog and Sox-2 along the EMT process and under stressful and hypoxic conditions. Moreover, the enhanced expression and/or activities of some drug resistance-associated molecules such as Bcl-2, Akt/molecular target of rapamycin (mTOR), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB), hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1) and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) multidrug transporters frequently occur in cancer cells during cancer progression and metastases. These molecular events may cooperate for the survival and acquisition of a more aggressive and migratory behavior by cancer stem/progenitor cells and their progenies during cancer transition to metastatic and recurrent disease states. Of therapeutic interest, these altered gene products may also be exploited as molecular biomarkers and therapeutic targets to develop novel multitargeted strategies for improving current cancer therapies and preventing disease relapse.",
    "Alternative polyadenylation sites reveal distinct chromatin accessibility and histone modification in human cell lines. MOTIVATION: In addition to alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation has also been identified as a critical and prevalent regulatory mechanism in human gene expression. However, the mechanism of alternative polyadenylation selection and the involved factors is still largely unknown. RESULTS: We use the ENCODE data to scan DNA functional elements, including chromatin accessibility and histone modification, around transcript cleavage sites. Our results demonstrate that polyadenylation sites tend to be less sensitive to DNase I. However, these polyadenylation sites have preference in nucleosome-depleted regions, indicating the involvement of chromatin higher-order structure rather than nucleosomes in the resultant lower chromatin accessibility. More interestingly, for genes using two polyadenylation sites, the distal sites show even lower chromatin accessibility compared with the proximal sites or the unique sites of genes using only one polyadenylation site. We also observe that the histone modification mark, histone H3 lysine 36 tri-methylation (H3K36Me3), exhibits different patterns around the cleavage sites of genes using multiple polyadenylation sites from those of genes using a single polyadenylation site. Surprisingly, the H3K36Me3 levels are comparable among the alternative polyadenylation sites themselves. In summary, polyadenylation and alternative polyadenylation are closely related to functional elements on the DNA level. CONTACT: liang.chen@usc.edu.",
    "An Algorithmic Approach to Management of Venous Thromboembolism. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Factors such as the presence of transient risk factors for VTE, risk of bleeding, and location of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) determine the duration of anticoagulation. Extended anticoagulation is offered to patients with unprovoked pulmonary embolism (PE) or proximal DVT and a low risk of bleeding. Anticoagulation for 3 months is advised in patients with provoked DVT or PE, high risk of bleeding, and isolated distal or upper extremity DVT. In patients with unprovoked PE or proximal DVT and a low risk of bleeding, who want to stop anticoagulation after 3 months, further risk stratification is necessary. Clinical scoring system, and thrombophilia testing otherwise not routinely performed, may be considered to measure risk of annual recurrence in such cases. Short-term anticoagulation may be considered in subsegmental PE and superficial vein thrombosis, particularly if patients are at low risk of bleeding and have persistent risk factors for recurrent VTE. In cases of catheter-associated thrombosis, the catheter need not be removed routinely, and the patient may be anticoagulated for 3 months or longer if the catheter is maintained in patients with cancer. Extensive screening for occult cancer in cases of unprovoked VTE is not beneficial. New oral anticoagulants such as apixaban, rivaroxaban, or dabigatran may be preferred to vitamin K antagonists in patients without cancer or renal failure, more so after the development of reversal agents such as idarucizumab and andexanet alfa.",
    "An alternative to killing? Treatment of reservoir hosts to control a vector and pathogen in a susceptible species. Parasite-mediated apparent competition occurs when one species affects another through the action of a shared parasite. One way of controlling the parasite in the more susceptible host is to manage the reservoir host. Culling can cause issues in terms of ethics and biodiversity impacts, therefore we ask: can treating, as compared to culling, a wildlife host protect a target species from the shared parasite? We used Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) models parameterized for the tick-borne louping ill virus (LIV) system. Deer are the key hosts of the vector (Ixodes ricinus) that transmits LIV to red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus, causing high mortality. The model was run under scenarios of varying acaricide efficacy and deer densities. The model predicted that treating deer can increase grouse density through controlling ticks and LIV, if acaricide efficacies are high and deer densities low. Comparing deer treated with 70% acaricide efficacy with a 70% cull rate suggested that treatment may be more effective than culling if initial deer densities are high. Our results will help inform tick control policies, optimize the targeting of control methods and identify conditions where host management is most likely to succeed. Our approach is applicable to other host-vector-pathogen systems.",
    "An important role for cholecystokinin, a CLOCK target gene, in the development and treatment of manic-like behaviors. Mice with a mutation in the Clock gene (Clock\u039419) have been identified as a model of mania; however, the mechanisms that underlie this phenotype, and the changes in the brain that are necessary for lithium's effectiveness on these mice remain unclear. Here, we find that cholecystokinin (Cck) is a direct transcriptional target of CLOCK and levels of Cck are reduced in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of Clock\u039419 mice. Selective knockdown of Cck expression via RNA interference in the VTA of wild-type mice produces a manic-like phenotype. Moreover, chronic treatment with lithium restores Cck expression to near wild-type and this increase is necessary for the therapeutic actions of lithium. The decrease in Cck expression in the Clock\u039419 mice appears to be due to a lack of interaction with the histone methyltransferase, MLL1, resulting in decreased histone H3K4me3 and gene transcription, an effect reversed by lithium. Human postmortem tissue from bipolar subjects reveals a similar increase in Cck expression in the VTA with mood stabilizer treatment. These studies identify a key role for Cck in the development and treatment of mania, and describe some of the molecular mechanisms by which lithium may act as an effective antimanic agent.",
    "An oral Syk kinase inhibitor in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: a three-month randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II study in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis that did not respond to biologic agents. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of R788 (fostamatinib disodium), an inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that did not respond to biologic therapies. METHODS: A total of 219 patients with active RA in whom treatment with biologic agents had failed were enrolled in a 3-month multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of R788. The primary end point was the percentage of patients who met the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (achieved an ACR20 response) at month 3. Secondary end points included changes in inflammation and damage, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and changes in the Disease Activity Score. RESULTS: The ACR20 response in the R788 100 mg twice daily group was 38%, versus 37% in the placebo group, at month 3. No significant differences were achieved in the ACR20, ACR50, or ACR70 response levels at 3 months. There were differences between the groups from baseline to month 3 in the secondary end points C-reactive protein (CRP) level and synovitis score on MRI. There were baseline differences in steroid use, prior biologic use, and synovitis score on MRI between the R788 group and the placebo group that may have affected the outcomes. A high placebo response rate was seen in this trial, and exploratory analysis suggested that this may in part have been driven by patients who entered the trial with an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate but normal CRP level. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that there were no differences in the primary end point between the R788 and placebo groups. Differences were observed between the R788 and placebo groups in secondary end points, particularly in those patients who entered the study with an elevated CRP level.",
    "Analysis of the CFTR gene in Iranian cystic fibrosis patients: identification of eight novel mutations. BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common inherited disorder in Caucasian populations, with over 1400 mutations identified in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene. Mutations in the CFTR gene may be also causative for CBAVD (Congenital Bilateral Absence of the Vas Deferens). The type and distribution of mutations varies widely between different countries and/or ethnic groups, and is relatively unknown in Iran. We therefore performed a comprehensive analysis of the CFTR gene in Iranian CF patients. METHODS: 69 Iranian CF patients, and 1 CBAVD patient, were analysed for mutations in the complete coding region, and its exon/intron junctions, of their CFTR genes, using different methods, such as ARMS (amplification refractory mutation system)-PCR, SSCP (single stranded conformation polymorphism) analysis, restriction enzyme digestion analysis, direct sequencing, and MLPA (Multiplex Ligation-mediated Probe Amplification). RESULTS: CFTR mutation analysis revealed the identification of 37 mutations in 69 Iranian CF patients. Overall, 81.9% (113/138) CFTR genes derived from Iranian CF patients could be characterized for a disease-causing mutation. The CBAVD patient was found to be homozygous for the p.W1145R mutation. The most common mutations were p.F508del (DeltaF508) (18.1%), c.2183_2184delAAinsG (2183AA>G) (6.5%), p.S466X (5.8%), p.N1303K (4.3%), c.2789+5G>A (4.3%), p.G542X (3.6%), c.3120+1G>A (3.6%), p.R334W (2.9%) and c.3130delA (2.9%). These 9 types of mutant CFTR genes totaled for 52% of all CFTR genes derived from the 69 Iranian CF patients. Eight mutations, c.406-8T>C, p.A566D, c.2576delA, c.2752-1_2756delGGTGGCinsTTG, p.T1036I, p.W1145R, c.3850-24G>A, c.1342-?_1524+?del, were found for the first time in this study. CONCLUSIONS: We identified 37 CFTR mutations in 69 well characterized Iranian CF patients, obtaining a CFTR mutation detection rate of 81.9%, the highest detection rate obtained in the Iranian population so far. These findings will assist in genetic counseling, prenatal diagnosis and future screening of CF in Iran.",
    "Anti-PD-1 synergizes with cyclophosphamide to induce potent anti-tumor vaccine effects through novel mechanisms. Programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1) is expressed on T cells following TCR activation. Binding of this receptor to its cognate ligands, programmed death ligand (PDL)-1 and PDL-2, down-regulates signals by the TCR, promoting T-cell anergy and apoptosis, thus leading to immune suppression. Here, we find that using an anti-PD-1 antibody (CT-011) with Treg-cell depletion by low-dose cyclophosphamide (CPM), combined with a tumor vaccine, induces synergistic antigen-specific immune responses and reveals novel activities of each agent in this combination. This strategy led to complete regression of established tumors in a significant percentage of treated animals, with survival prolongation. We show for the first time that combining CT-011 and CPM significantly increases the number of vaccine-induced tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells, with simultaneous decrease in infiltrating Treg cells. Interestingly, we find that CT-011 prolongs Treg-cell inhibition induced by CPM, leading to a sustainable significant synergistic decrease of splenic and tumor-infiltrated Treg cells. Surprisingly, we find that the anti-tumor effect elicited by the combination of CT-011 and CPM is dependent on both CD8(+) and CD4(+) T-cell responses, although the antigen we used is a class I MHC-restricted peptide. Thus, we describe a novel and effective therapeutic approach by combining multiple strategies to target several tumor-mediated immune inhibitory mechanisms.",
    "Application of hydrophilic interaction chromatography for the analysis of polar contaminants in food and environmental samples. For the analysis of highly hydrophilic and polar compounds, Hydrophilic Interaction Chromatography (HILIC) has been established as a valuable complementary approach to reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC). Moreover, the use of mobile phases with a high percentage of organic solvent in HILIC separation is beneficial for mass spectrometric (MS) detection, because of enhanced ionization which results in an increased sensitivity. In this review, various applications of HILIC are described for a number of environmental and food contaminants together with detailed methodological descriptions and the advantages or drawbacks of HILIC compared to other LC methods are critically discussed. In the first part of the review, an overview is given of the work that has been carried out with HILIC for the analysis of pharmaceuticals and pesticides in environmental samples. HILIC has shown its applicability for polar pharmaceuticals, such as antibiotics, estrogens and their metabolites, drugs of abuse, cytostatics, metformin and contrast agents. In the pesticide group, HILIC chromatography was helpful for polar phenylurea and organophosphorus pesticides. The second part of the review focuses on the analysis of antibiotic residues in food and feed with HILIC, while in the pesticide group, HILIC experiments have been reported for dithiocarbamates and quaternary ammonium compounds. The last chapter gives an overview of the analysis by HILIC of miscellaneous analytes in aquatic and food/feed samples.",
    "Arf6-GEF BRAG1 regulates JNK-mediated synaptic removal of GluA1-containing AMPA receptors: a new mechanism for nonsyndromic X-linked mental disorder. Activity-dependent modifications of excitatory synapses contribute to synaptic maturation and plasticity, and are critical for learning and memory. Consequently, impairments in synapse formation or synaptic transmission are thought to be responsible for several types of mental disabilities. BRAG1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTP-binding protein Arf6 that localizes to the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses. Mutations in BRAG1 have been identified in families with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). These mutations mapped to either the catalytic domain or an IQ-like motif; however, the pathophysiological basis of these mutations remains unknown. Here, we show that the BRAG1 IQ motif binds apo-calmodulin (CaM), and that calcium-induced CaM release triggers a reversible conformational change in human BRAG1. We demonstrate that BRAG1 activity, stimulated by activation of NMDA-sensitive glutamate receptors, depresses AMPA receptor (AMPA-R)-mediated transmission via JNK-mediated synaptic removal of GluA1-containing AMPA-Rs in rat hippocampal neurons. Importantly, a BRAG1 mutant that fails to activate Arf6 also fails to depress AMPA-R signaling, indicating that Arf6 activity is necessary for this process. Conversely, a mutation in the BRAG1 IQ-like motif that impairs CaM binding results in hyperactivation of Arf6 signaling and constitutive depression of AMPA transmission. Our findings reveal a role for BRAG1 in response to neuronal activity with possible clinical relevance to nonsyndromic XLID.",
    "Assessing serotonin receptor mRNA editing frequency by a novel ultra high-throughput sequencing method. RNA editing is a post-transcriptional modification of pre-mRNA that results in increased diversity in transcriptomes and proteomes. It occurs in a wide variety of eukaryotic organisms and in some viruses. One of the most common forms of pre-mRNA editing is A-to-I editing, in which adenosine is deaminated to inosine, which is read as guanosine during translation. This phenomenon has been observed in numerous transcripts, including the mammalian 5-HT(2C) receptor, which can be edited at five distinct sites. Methods used to date to quantify 5-HT(2C) receptor editing are labor-intensive, expensive and provide limited information regarding the relative abundance of 5-HT(2C) receptor editing variants. Here, we present a novel, ultra high-throughput method to quantify 5-HT(2C) receptor editing, compare it to a more conventional method, and use it to assess the effect of a range of genetic and pharmacologic manipulations on 5-HT(2C) editing. We conclude that this new method is powerful and economical, and we provide evidence that alterations in 5-HT(2C) editing appear to be a result of regional changes in brain activity, rather than a mechanism to normalize 5-HT(2C) signaling.",
    "Assessment and quantification of telomerase enzyme activity. The enzyme telomerase is activated in 80-90% of all human malignancies and immortal cell lines, where it functions to maintain the integrity of chromosomal-end structures called telomeres. Telomerase enzyme activity can be detected in whole cell lysates by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method referred to as the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP). The TRAP assay involves extension of an oligonucleotide through telomerase-mediated enzymatic addition of telomeric DNA repeats and subsequent PCR amplification of the extension products. While the TRAP assay as originally developed utilizes radioactively labelled nucleotides, protocols are provided herein for nonradioactive versions of the TRAP assay, with options for either qualitative assessment of TRAP products by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (standard TRAP), or quantitative analysis by real-time PCR (Q-TRAP). The Q-TRAP method poses the additional advantages of exquisite sensitivity, rapidity, and potential for adoption to a high-throughput format.",
    "Assessment of pain and itch behavior in a mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1. UNLABELLED: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is characterized primarily by tumor formation in the nervous system, but patients report other neurological complications including pain and itch. Individuals with NF1 harbor 1 mutated NF1 allele causing heterozygous expression in all of their cells. In mice, Nf1 heterozygosity leads to hyperexcitability of sensory neurons and hyperproliferation of mast cells, both of which could lead to increased hypersensitivity and scratching in response to noxious and pruritic stimuli. To determine whether Nf1 heterozygosity may increase pain and itch behaviors independent of secondary effects of tumor formation, we used mice with a targeted, heterozygous Nf1 gene deletion (Nf1\u00b1) that lack tumors. Nf1\u00b1 mice exhibited normal baseline responses to thermal and mechanical stimuli. Moreover, similar to wild-type littermates, Nf1\u00b1 mice developed inflammation-induced heat\u00a0and mechanical hypersensitivity, capsaicin-induced nocifensive behavior, histamine-dependent or -independent scratching, and chronic constriction injury-induced cold allodynia. However, Nf1\u00b1\u00a0mice exhibited an attenuated first phase of formalin-induced spontaneous behavior and expedited resolution of formalin-induced heat hypersensitivity. These results are not consistent with the hypothesis that Nf1 heterozygosity alone is sufficient to increase pain and itch sensation in mice, and they suggest that additional mechanisms may underlie reports of increased pain and itch in NF1 patients. PERSPECTIVE: This study assessed whether Nf1 heterozygosity in mice increased hypersensitivity and scratching following noxious and pruritic stimuli. Using Nf1\u00b1 mice lacking tumors, this study finds no increases in pain or itch behavior, suggesting that there is no predisposition for either clinical symptom solely due to Nf1 heterozygosity.",
    "Association between levels of IgA antibodies to tissue transglutaminase and gliadin-related nonapeptides in dermatitis herpetiformis. Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an autoimmunity-driven inflammatory blistering dermatosis associated with a gluten-dependent enteropathy. Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and nonapeptides of gliadin (npG) are considered in its pathomechanism/diagnostics. Here, the diagnostic accuracy of anti-tTG/anti-npG IgA ELISAs in Slavic DH patients with active skin rash was assessed through creating receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, determining cutoff values, and calculating correlations between levels of anti-tTG/anti-npG IgA in DH, IgA/neutrophil-mediated non-DH patients and healthy persons. Altogether, sera from 80 Slavic individuals were examined. There were negligible differences between cutoff points obtained by the ELISAs manufacturer and those in this study. There were statistically significant correlations between levels of anti-tTG/anti-npG IgA in both DH group and the group of IgA/neutrophil-mediated non-DH dermatoses. There was no such correlation in healthy controls. It seems that IgA autoantibodies to tTG and npG in the IgA/neutrophil-mediated DH are produced in the coordinated way implying their causal relationship.",
    "Autoimmune dacryoadenitis of NOD/LtJ mice and its subsequent effects on tear protein composition. Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (SjS) is a human autoimmune disease characterized by exocrine dysfunction resulting from chronic autoimmune attack primarily against the lacrimal and/or salivary glands. Although, we previously established a good correlation between SjS in humans and autoimmune exocrinopathy in NOD/LtJ mice an in-depth evaluation of lacrimal gland disease in the NOD/LtJ mouse has remained limited. This leaves a major gap in our understanding of the dacryoadenitis/keratoconjunctivitis sicca in this model. Here we characterize the development of the autoimmune dacryoadenitis in NOD/LtJ and NOD.B10-H2(b) mice in comparison with age- and sex-matched nonautoimmune CD1 mice. We observed a decline in tear production beginning at 8 weeks of age in both NOD/LtJ and NOD.B10-H2(b) mice, continuing throughout the 40 to 46 weeks studied. This correlated with a quantifiable increase in mixed T- and B-lymphocyte infiltrations in the extraorbital lacrimal glands. In addition, temporal differences in tear protein expression between NOD/LtJ and CD1 mice were identified using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry. Thus, using this model we can identify potentially important pathophysiological mechanisms of the autoimmune attack and possible diagnostic markers for development of SjS-associated dacryoadenitis.",
    "Autosomal XX sex reversal caused by duplication of SOX9. SOX9 is one of the genes that play critical roles in male sexual differentiation. Mutations of SOX9 leading to haploinsufficiency can cause campomelic dysplasia and XY sex reversal. We report here evidence supporting that SOX9 duplication can cause XX sex reversal. A newborn infant was referred for genetic evaluation because of abnormal male external genitalia. The infant had severe penile/scrotal hypospadias. Gonads were palpable. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated a de novo mosaic 46,XX,dup(17)(q23.1q24.3)/46, XX karyotype. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with a BAC clone containing the SOX9 gene demonstrated that the SOX9 gene is duplicated on the rearranged chromosome 17. The presence of SRY was ruled out by FISH with a probe containing the SRY gene and polymerase chain reaction with SRY-specific primers. Microsatellite analysis with 13 markers on 17q23-24 determined that the duplication is maternal in origin and defined the boundary of the duplication to be approximately 12 centimorgans (cM) proximal and 4 cM distal to the SOX9 gene. Thus, SOX9 duplication is the most likely cause for the sex reversal in this case because it plays an important role in male sex determination and differentiation. This study suggests that extra dose of SOX9 is sufficient to initiate testis differentiation in the absence of SRY. Other SRY-negative XX sex-reversed individuals deserve thorough investigation of SOX9 gene.",
    "Avascular necrosis of the femoral head among children and adolescents with sickle cell disease in Greece. Hemoglobinopathies are very common in Greece, the incidence of beta-thalassemia trait being 8% and that of sickle cell trait ranging from 1 to 32% in various districts. In Greek populations, sickle cell disease (SCD) is mainly represented by S-beta thalassemia.",
    "BPP: a sequence-based algorithm for branch point prediction. Motivation: Although high-throughput sequencing methods have been proposed to identify splicing branch points in the human genome, these methods can only detect a small fraction of the branch points subject to the sequencing depth, experimental cost and the expression level of the mRNA. An accurate computational model for branch point prediction is therefore an ongoing objective in human genome research. Results: We here propose a novel branch point prediction algorithm that utilizes information on the branch point sequence and the polypyrimidine tract. Using experimentally validated data, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods. Availability and implementation: https://github.com/zhqingit/BPP.

    "BRCA1 tumor suppression depends on BRCT phosphoprotein binding, but not its E3 ligase activity. Germline mutations of the breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) gene are a major cause of familial breast and ovarian cancer. The BRCA1 protein displays E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and this enzymatic function is thought to be required for tumor suppression. To test this hypothesis, we generated mice that express an enzymatically defective Brca1. We found that this mutant Brca1 prevents tumor formation to the same degree as does wild-type Brca1 in three different genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models of cancer. In contrast, a mutation that ablates phosphoprotein recognition by the BRCA C terminus (BRCT) domains of BRCA1 elicits tumors in each of the three GEM models. Thus, BRCT phosphoprotein recognition, but not the E3 ligase activity, is required for BRCA1 tumor suppression.",
    "Bach1-dependent and -independent regulation of heme oxygenase-1 in keratinocytes. Bach1 is a member of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor family, and the Bach1/small Maf heterodimer specifically represses transcriptional activity directed by the Maf recognition element (MARE). Because Bach1 is a repressor of the oxidative stress response, we examined the function(s) of Bach1 in keratinocytes subjected to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress induced by H(2)O(2) led to an increase in MARE activity and expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an inducible antioxidant defense enzyme. Bach1 depletion by small interfering RNAs or by deletion of Bach1 enhanced HO-1 expression in the absence of H(2)O(2), indicating that Bach1 is a critical repressor of HO-1 in keratinocytes. Although Bach1-deficient or -reduced keratinocytes expressed higher levels of HO-1 than control cells in response to H(2)O(2), Bach1 down-regulation did not attenuate the production of reactive oxygen species by H(2)O(2). In contrast, Bach1 overexpression abolished HO-1 induction by H(2)O(2), which led to increased reactive oxygen species accumulation. HO-1 was induced during keratinocyte differentiation, but MARE activity did not change during differentiation. Furthermore, Bach1 overexpression did not inhibit differentiation-associated induction of HO-1 expression, suggesting that HO-1 induction in differentiation is independent of Bach1. Thus, in response to oxidative stress, Bach1 regulates the oxidation state through the negative control of HO-1 expression prior to terminal keratinocyte differentiation. However, Bach1-mediated repression is negated during keratinocyte differentiation.",
    "Balanced t(11;15)(q23;q15) in a TP53+/+ breast cancer patient from a Li-Fraumeni syndrome family. Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is characterized by early-onset carcinogenesis involving multiple tumor types and shows autosomal dominant inheritance. Approximately 70% of LFS cases are due to germline mutations in the TP53 gene on chromosome 17p13.1. Mutations have also been found in the CHEK2 gene on chromosome 22q11, and others have been mapped to chromosome 11q23. While characterizing an LFS family with a documented defect in TP53, we found one family member who developed bilateral breast cancer at age 37 yet was homozygous for wild-type TP53. Her mother also developed early-onset primary bilateral breast cancer, and a sister had unilateral breast cancer and a soft tissue sarcoma. Cytogenetic analysis using fluorescence in situ hybridization of a primary skin fibroblast cell line revealed that the patient had a novel balanced reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 11 and 15: t(11;15)(q23;q15). This translocation was not present in a primary skin fibroblast cell line from a brother with neuroblastoma, who was heterozygous for the TP53 mutation. There was no evidence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in either the patient or her mother, although a nephew did develop leukemia and died in childhood. These data may implicate the region at breakpoint 11q23 and/or 15q15 as playing a significant role in predisposition to breast cancer development.",
    "Barth syndrome: cellular compensation of mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis inhibition due to changes in cardiolipin remodeling linked to tafazzin (TAZ) gene mutation. Cardiolipin is a mitochondrion-specific phospholipid that stabilizes the assembly of respiratory chain complexes, favoring full-yield operation. It also mediates key steps in apoptosis. In Barth syndrome, an X chromosome-linked cardiomyopathy caused by tafazzin mutations, cardiolipins display acyl chain modifications and are present at abnormally low concentrations, whereas monolysocardiolipin accumulates. Using immortalized lymphoblasts from Barth syndrome patients, we showed that the production of abnormal cardiolipin led to mitochondrial alterations. Indeed, the lack of normal cardiolipin led to changes in electron transport chain stability, resulting in cellular defects. We found a destabilization of the supercomplex (respirasome) I+III2+IVn but also decreased amounts of individual complexes I and IV and supercomplexes I+III and III+IV. No changes were observed in the amounts of individual complex III and complex II. We also found decreased levels of complex V. This complex is not part of the supercomplex suggesting that cardiolipin is required not only for the association/stabilization of the complexes into supercomplexes but also for the modulation of the amount of individual respiratory chain complexes. However, these alterations were compensated by an increase in mitochondrial mass, as demonstrated by electron microscopy and measurements of citrate synthase activity. We suggest that this compensatory increase in mitochondrial content prevents a decrease in mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis in the cells. We also show, by extensive flow cytometry analysis, that the type II apoptosis pathway was blocked at the mitochondrial level and that the mitochondria of patients with Barth syndrome cannot bind active caspase-8. Signal transduction is thus blocked before any mitochondrial event can occur. Remarkably, basal levels of superoxide anion production were slightly higher in patients' cells than in control cells as previously evidenced via an increased protein carbonylation in the taz1\u0394 mutant in the yeast. This may be deleterious to cells in the long term. The consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction and alterations to apoptosis signal transduction are considered in light of the potential for the development of future treatments.",
    "Bertolotti syndrome: a diagnostic and management dilemma for pain physicians. BACKGROUND: Bertolotti's syndrome (BS), a form of lumbago in lumbosacral transitional vertebrae, is an important cause of low back pain in young patients. The purpose of this study was to assess the etiology of low back pain and the efficacy of treatment offered to patients with BS. METHODS: All patients of BS Castellvi type1a during a period of 6 months were enrolled in the study. The patients underwent interventional pain procedures for diagnosis and pain relief. Response to the therapy was assessed based on VAS and ODI scores. A 50% decrease in VAS score or a VAS score less than 3 would be considered adequate pain relief. RESULTS: All 20 patients diagnosed with BS during the 6-month observation period had scoliosis. Common causes of back pain were the ipsilateral L5-S1 facet joint, neoarticulation, the SI joint, and disc degeneration. Responses to various interventions for pain relief were different and inconsistent from patient to patient. In particular, responses to interventions for neoarticular pain were generally poor. CONCLUSIONS: Pain in patients with BS does not usually respond to interventional pain treatment. A very dynamic treatment approach must be pursued while managing BS patients, and the treatment plan must be individualized at various stages in order to obtain satisfactory pain relief.",
    "Binding of EBP50 to Nox organizing subunit p47phox is pivotal to cellular reactive species generation and altered vascular phenotype. Despite numerous reports implicating NADPH oxidases (Nox) in the pathogenesis of many diseases, precise regulation of this family of professional reactive oxygen species (ROS) producers remains unclear. A unique member of this family, Nox1 oxidase, functions as either a canonical or hybrid system using Nox organizing subunit 1 (NoxO1) or p47(phox), respectively, the latter of which is functional in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). In this manuscript, we identify critical requirement of ezrin-radixin-moesin-binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50; aka NHERF1) for Nox1 activation and downstream responses. Superoxide (O2 (\u2022-)) production induced by angiotensin II (AngII) was absent in mouse EBP50 KO VSMC vs. WT. Moreover, ex vivo incubation of aortas with AngII showed a significant increase in O2 (\u2022-) in WT but not EBP50 or Nox1 nulls. Similarly, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced oxidative stress was attenuated in femoral arteries from EBP50 KO vs. WT. In silico analyses confirmed by confocal microscopy, immunoprecipitation, proximity ligation assay, FRET, and gain-/loss-of-function mutagenesis revealed binding of EBP50, via its PDZ domains, to a specific motif in p47(phox) Functional studies revealed AngII-induced hypertrophy was absent in EBP50 KOs, and in VSMC overexpressing EBP50, Nox1 gene silencing abolished VSMC hypertrophy. Finally, ex vivo measurement of lumen diameter in mouse resistance arteries exhibited attenuated AngII-induced vasoconstriction in EBP50 KO vs. WT. Taken together, our data identify EBP50 as a previously unidentified regulator of Nox1 and support that it promotes Nox1 activity by binding p47(phox) This interaction is pivotal for agonist-induced smooth muscle ROS, hypertrophy, and vasoconstriction and has implications for ROS-mediated physiological and pathophysiological processes.",
    "Bioequivalence of different dose-strength tablets of selexipag, a selective prostacyclin receptor agonist, in a multiple-dose up-titration study. OBJECTIVE: Selexipag is a novel, oral, selective prostacyclin (PGI2) receptor agonist in clinical development for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Film-coated tablets with strength between 200 and 1,600 \u03bcg were used. Bioequivalence between 8 x 200 \u03bcg and a new 1,600 \u03bcg tablet was evaluated at steady state in healthy male subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was an open-label, 2-treatment, 2-period, crossover, up-titration, phase 1 study. The treatments were selexipag at 1,600 \u03bcg b.i.d. for 4.5 days either as 8 x 200 \u03bcg tablets (reference: A) or 1 x 1,600 \u03bcg tablet (test: B), both preceded by an up-titration phase starting from 400 \u03bcg b.i.d. doses, in 200-\u03bcg steps every 4th day. Subjects were randomized 1 : 1 to the A-B or B-A sequence. The pharmacokinetics and tolerability of selexipag and its active metabolite, ACT-333679, were investigated. RESULTS: 80 subjects were enrolled in the study: 65 subjects completed the study according to protocol, and 15 subjects withdrew from the study. The most frequent adverse events (AEs) were headache (86%), myalgia (73%), and jaw pain (73%). There was no difference in nature and overall frequency of AEs between the two treatments. Steady state was attained within 3 days of the selexipag 1,600 \u00ce\u00bcg b.i.d. TREATMENTS: The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the geometric mean ratio (B/A) at steady state for AUC\u00cf\u0084 and Cmax,ss were within (0.80, 1.25) bioequivalence interval: (0.92, 1.06) and (0.95, 1.14), respectively, for selexipag and (0.95, 1.06) and (0.94, 1.07), respectively, for the active metabolite, ACT-333679. CONCLUSIONS: Bioequivalence was demonstrated between 8 x 200 \u03bcg and 1 x 1,600 \u03bcg selexipag at steady state.",
    "Biofoams and natural protein surfactants. Naturally occurring foam constituent and surfactant proteins with intriguing structures and functions are now being identified from a variety of biological sources. The ranaspumins from tropical frog foam nests comprise a range of proteins with a mixture of surfactant, carbohydrate binding and antimicrobial activities that together provide a stable, biocompatible, protective foam environment for developing eggs and embryos. Ranasmurfin, a blue protein from a different species of frog, displays a novel structure with a unique chromophoric crosslink. Latherin, primarily from horse sweat, but with similarities to salivary, oral and upper respiratory tract proteins, illustrates several potential roles for surfactant proteins in mammalian systems. These proteins, together with the previously discovered hydrophobins of fungi, throw new light on biomolecular processes at air-water and other interfaces. This review provides a perspective on these recent findings, focussing on structure and biophysical properties.",
    "Biological implications of selenium and its role in trypanosomiasis treatment. Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element for several organisms and is present in proteins as selenocysteine (Sec or U), an amino acid that is chemically distinct from serine and cysteine by a single atom (Se instead of O or S, respectively). Sec is incorporated into selenoproteins at an in-frame UGA codon specified by an mRNA stem-loop structure called the selenocysteine incorporating sequence (SECIS) presented in selenoprotein mRNA and specific selenocysteine synthesis and incorporation machinery. Selenoproteins are presented in all domains but are not found in all organisms. Although several functions have been attributed to this class, the majority of the proteins are involved in oxidative stress defense. Here, we discuss the kinetoplastid selenocysteine pathway and how selenium supplementation is able to alter the infection course of trypanosomatids in detail. These organisms possess the canonical elements required for selenoprotein production such as phosphoseryl tRNA kinase (PSTK), selenocysteine synthase (SepSecS), selenophosphase synthase (SelD or SPS), and elongation factor EFSec (SelB), whereas other important factors presented in mammal cells, such as SECIS binding protein 2 (SBP) and SecP 43, are absent. The selenoproteome of trypanosomatids is small, as is the selenoproteome of others parasites, which is in contrast to the large number of selenoproteins found in bacteria, aquatic organisms and higher eukaryotes. Trypanosoma and Leishmania are sensitive to auranofin, a potent selenoprotein inhibitor; however, the probable drug mechanism is not related to selenoproteins in kinetoplastids. Selenium supplementation decreases the parasitemia of various Trypanosome infections and reduces important parameters associated with diseases such as anemia and parasite-induced organ damage. New experiments are necessary to determine how selenium acts, but evidence suggests that immune response modulation and increased host defense against oxidative stress contribute to control of the parasite infection.",
    "Birth of a metabolic gene cluster in yeast by adaptive gene relocation. Although most eukaryotic genomes lack operons, they contain some physical clusters of genes that are related in function despite being unrelated in sequence. How these clusters are formed during evolution is unknown. The DAL cluster is the largest metabolic gene cluster in yeast and consists of six adjacent genes encoding proteins that enable Saccharomyces cerevisiae to use allantoin as a nitrogen source. We show here that the DAL cluster was assembled, quite recently in evolutionary terms, through a set of genomic rearrangements that happened almost simultaneously. Six of the eight genes involved in allantoin degradation, which were previously scattered around the genome, became relocated to a single subtelomeric site in an ancestor of S. cerevisiae and Saccharomyces castellii. These genomic rearrangements coincided with a biochemical reorganization of the purine degradation pathway, which switched to importing allantoin instead of urate. This change eliminated urate oxidase, one of several oxygen-consuming enzymes that were lost by yeasts that can grow vigorously in anaerobic conditions. The DAL cluster is located in a domain of modified chromatin involving both H2A.Z histone exchange and Hst1-Sum1-mediated histone deacetylation, and it may be a coadapted gene complex formed by epistatic selection.",
    "Branched chain amino acid suppresses hepatocellular cancer stem cells through the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin. Differentiation of cancer stem cells (CSCs) into cancer cells causes increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. Although inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) leads to CSC survival, the effect of branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), an mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activator remains unknown. In this study, we examined the effects of BCAA on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells expressing a hepatic CSC marker, EpCAM. We examined the effects of BCAA and/or 5-fluorouracil (FU) on expression of EpCAM and other CSC-related markers, as well as cell proliferation in HCC cells and in a xenograft mouse model. We also characterized CSC-related and mTOR signal-related molecule expression and tumorigenicity in HCC cells with knockdown of Rictor or Raptor, or overexpression of constitutively active rheb (caRheb). mTOR signal-related molecule expression was also examined in BCAA-treated HCC cells. In-vitro BCAA reduced the frequency of EpCAM-positive cells and improved sensitivity to the anti-proliferative effect of 5-FU. Combined 5-FU and BCAA provided better antitumor efficacy than 5-FU alone in the xenograft model. Stimulation with high doses of BCAA activated mTORC1. Knockdown and overexpression experiments revealed that inhibition of mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) or activation of mTORC1 led to decreased EpCAM expression and little or no tumorigenicity. BCAA may enhance the sensitivity to chemotherapy by reducing the population of cscs via the mTOR pathway. This result suggests the utility of BCAA in liver cancer therapy.",
    "Breast cancer phenotype in women with TP53 germline mutations: a Li-Fraumeni syndrome consortium effort. Breast cancer is the most common tumor in women with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS), an inherited cancer syndrome associated with germline mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene. Their lifetime breast cancer risk is 49% by age 60. Breast cancers in TP53 mutation carriers recently have more often been reported to be hormone receptor and HER-2 positive by immunohistochemistry and FISH in small series. We seek to complement the existing small literature with this report of a histopathologic analysis of breast cancers from women with documented LFS. Unstained slides and paraffin-embedded tumor blocks from breast cancers from 39 germline TP53 mutation carriers were assembled from investigators in the LFS consortium. Central histology review was performed on 93% of the specimens by a single breast pathologist from a major university hospital. Histology, grade, and hormone receptor status were assessed by immunohistochemistry; HER-2 status was defined by immunohistochemistry and/or FISH. The 43 tumors from 39 women comprise 32 invasive ductal carcinomas and 11 ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS). No other histologies were observed. The median age at diagnosis was 32\u00a0years (range 22-46). Of the invasive cancers, 84% were positive for ER and/or PR; and 81% were high grade. Sixty three percent of invasive and 73% of in situ carcinomas were positive for Her2/neu (IHC 3+ or FISH amplified). Of the invasive tumors, 53% were positive for both ER and HER2+; other ER/PR/HER2 combinations were observed. The DCIS were positive for ER and HER2 in 27% of the cases. This report of the phenotype of breast cancers from women with LFS nearly doubles the literature on this topic. Most DCIS and invasive ductal carcinomas in LFS are hormone receptor positive and/or HER-2 positive. These findings suggest that modern treatments may result in improved outcomes for women with LFS-associated breast cancer.",
    "Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) function is important to the development and expansion of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by constitutive activation of the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway, but variable responsiveness of the BCR to antigen ligation. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) shows constitutive activity in CLL and is the target of irreversible inhibition by ibrutinib, an orally bioavailable kinase inhibitor that has shown outstanding activity in CLL. Early clinical results in CLL with other reversible and irreversible BTK inhibitors have been less promising, however, raising the question of whether BTK kinase activity is an important target of ibrutinib and also in CLL. To determine the role of BTK in CLL, we used patient samples and the E\u03bc-TCL1 (TCL1) transgenic mouse model of CLL, which results in spontaneous leukemia development. Inhibition of BTK in primary human CLL cells by small interfering RNA promotes apoptosis. Inhibition of BTK kinase activity through either targeted genetic inactivation or ibrutinib in the TCL1 mouse significantly delays the development of CLL, demonstrating that BTK is a critical kinase for CLL development and expansion and thus an important target of ibrutinib. Collectively, our data confirm the importance of kinase-functional BTK in CLL.",
    "C9ORF72 and UBQLN2 mutations are causes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in New Zealand: a genetic and pathologic study using banked human brain tissue. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease, which causes progressive and eventually fatal loss of motor function. Here, we describe genetic and pathologic characterization of brain tissue banked from 19 ALS patients over nearly 20\u00a0years at the Department of Anatomy and the Centre for Brain Research, University of Auckland, New Zealand. We screened for mutations in SOD1, TARDBP, FUS, and C9ORF72 genes and for neuropathology caused by phosphorylated TDP-43, dipeptide repeats (DPRs), and ubiquilin. We identified 2 cases with C9ORF72 repeat expansions. Both harbored phosphorylated TDP-43 and DPR inclusions. We show that DPR inclusions can incorporate or occur independently of ubiquilin. We also identified 1 case with a UBQLN2 mutation, which showed phosphorylated TDP-43 and characteristic ubiquilin protein inclusions. This is the first study of ALS genetics in New Zealand, adding New Zealand to the growing list of countries in which C9ORF72 repeat expansion and UBQLN2 mutations are detected in ALS cases.",

    "CAGEr: precise TSS data retrieval and high-resolution promoterome mining for integrative analyses. Cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) is a high-throughput method for transcriptome analysis that provides a single base-pair resolution map of transcription start sites (TSS) and their relative usage. Despite their high resolution and functional significance, published CAGE data are still underused in promoter analysis due to the absence of tools that enable its efficient manipulation and integration with other genome data types. Here we present CAGEr, an R implementation of novel methods for the analysis of differential TSS usage and promoter dynamics, integrated with CAGE data processing and promoterome mining into a first comprehensive CAGE toolbox on a common analysis platform. Crucially, we provide collections of TSSs derived from most published CAGE datasets, as well as direct access to FANTOM5 resource of TSSs for numerous human and mouse cell/tissue types from within R, greatly increasing the accessibility of precise context-specific TSS data for integrative analyses. The CAGEr package is freely available from Bioconductor at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/CAGEr.html.",
    "CD38 expression predicts poor prognosis and might be a potential therapy target in extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, nasal type. No standard chemotherapy regimens have been defined yet for extranodal natural killer/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL), and the prognosis of patients with advanced or relapsed disease is very poor. Daratumumab, an investigated anti-cancer drug targeting CD38, has been of great interest in the treatment of CD38-expressing malignancies, especially multiple myeloma. In this study, we reviewed the clinical data of 94 patients with ENKTL, investigated the expression of CD38, and analyzed the prognostic value of CD38 expression. Forty-seven patients had weak expression of CD38, and the other 47 patients had strong expression. The complete response (CR) rate was significantly higher in patients who were treated with asparaginase-based therapy (83.8 vs. 59.6 %, p = 0.025). There was a trend towards higher CR rate in CD38 weak expression group (78.7 vs. 59.6 %, p = 0.074). At a median follow-up time of 42 months, the 2-year and 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 53.0 and 39.0 %, respectively, and the 2-year and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 68.0 and 58.0 %, respectively. In multivariate survival analysis including CD38 expression status, International Prognostic Index (IPI) score, local tumor invasion, and chemotherapy regimens, it was found that strong expression of CD38 and non-asparaginase-based chemoregimens were independent adverse prognostic factors for PFS (p = 0.009 and 0.027, respectively), while local tumor invasion and higher IPI score were independent adverse prognostic factors for OS (p = 0.002 and 0.035, respectively). In subgroup analysis, strong expression of CD38 significantly correlated with inferior survival outcomes in patients without local tumor invasion (p = 0.011) or with stage I-II disease (p = 0.008). In conclusion, we firstly found that the majority of ENKTL cases were CD38 positive, with half had strong expression of CD38, which significantly correlated with poor outcomes, indicating the potential role of CD38 as a therapy target for ENKTL.",
    "CEP proteins: the knights of centrosome dynasty. Centrosome forms the backbone of cell cycle progression mechanism. Recent debates have occurred regarding the essentiality of centrosome in cell cycle regulation. CEP family protein is the active component of centrosome and plays a vital role in centriole biogenesis and cell cycle progression control. A total of 31 proteins have been categorized into CEP family protein category and many more are under candidate evaluation. Furthermore, by the recent advancements in genomics and proteomics researches, several new CEP proteins have also been characterized. Here we have summarized the importance of CEP family proteins and their regulation mechanism involved in proper cell cycle progression. Further, we have reviewed the detailed molecular mechanism behind the associated pathological phenotypes and the possible therapeutic approaches. Proteins such as CEP57, CEP63, CEP152, CEP164, and CEP215 have been extensively studied with a detailed description of their molecular mechanisms, which are among the primary targets for drug discovery. Moreover, CEP27, CEP55, CEP70, CEP110, CEP120, CEP135, CEP192, CEP250, CEP290, and CEP350 also seem promising for future drug discovery approaches. Since the overview implicates that the overall researches on CEP proteins are not yet able to present significant details required for effective therapeutics development, thus, it is timely to discuss the importance of future investigations in this field.",
    "CLAST: CUDA implemented large-scale alignment search tool. BACKGROUND: Metagenomics is a powerful methodology to study microbial communities, but it is highly dependent on nucleotide sequence similarity searching against sequence databases. Metagenomic analyses with next-generation sequencing technologies produce enormous numbers of reads from microbial communities, and many reads are derived from microbes whose genomes have not yet been sequenced, limiting the usefulness of existing sequence similarity search tools. Therefore, there is a clear need for a sequence similarity search tool that can rapidly detect weak similarity in large datasets. RESULTS: We developed a tool, which we named CLAST (CUDA implemented large-scale alignment search tool), that enables analyses of millions of reads and thousands of reference genome sequences, and runs on NVIDIA Fermi architecture graphics processing units. CLAST has four main advantages over existing alignment tools. First, CLAST was capable of identifying sequence similarities ~80.8 times faster than BLAST and 9.6 times faster than BLAT. Second, CLAST executes global alignment as the default (local alignment is also an option), enabling CLAST to assign reads to taxonomic and functional groups based on evolutionarily distant nucleotide sequences with high accuracy. Third, CLAST does not need a preprocessed sequence database like Burrows-Wheeler Transform-based tools, and this enables CLAST to incorporate large, frequently updated sequence databases. Fourth, CLAST requires <2 GB of main memory, making it possible to run CLAST on a standard desktop computer or server node. CONCLUSIONS: CLAST achieved very high speed (similar to the Burrows-Wheeler Transform-based Bowtie 2 for long reads) and sensitivity (equal to BLAST, BLAT, and FR-HIT) without the need for extensive database preprocessing or a specialized computing platform. Our results demonstrate that CLAST has the potential to be one of the most powerful and realistic approaches to analyze the massive amount of sequence data from next-generation sequencing technologies.",
    "CRISPR-Cas: evolution of an RNA-based adaptive immunity system in prokaryotes. The CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, CRISPR-associated genes) is an adaptive immunity system in bacteria and archaea that functions via a distinct self-non-self recognition mechanism that is partially analogous to the mechanism of eukaryotic RNA interference (RNAi). The CRISPR-Cas system incorporates fragments of virus or plasmid DNA into the CRISPR repeat cassettes and employs the processed transcripts of these spacers as guide RNAs to cleave the cognate foreign DNA or RNA. The Cas proteins, however, are not homologous to the proteins involved in RNAi and comprise numerous, highly diverged families. The majority of the Cas proteins contain diverse variants of the RNA recognition motif (RRM), a widespread RNA-binding domain. Despite the fast evolution that is typical of the cas genes, the presence of diverse versions of the RRM in most Cas proteins provides for a simple scenario for the evolution of the three distinct types of CRISPR-cas systems. In addition to several proteins that are directly implicated in the immune response, the cas genes encode a variety of proteins that are homologous to prokaryotic toxins that typically possess nuclease activity. The predicted toxins associated with CRISPR-Cas systems include the essential Cas2 protein, proteins of COG1517 that, in addition to a ligand-binding domain and a helix-turn-helix domain, typically contain different nuclease domains and several other predicted nucleases. The tight association of the CRISPR-Cas immunity systems with predicted toxins that, upon activation, would induce dormancy or cell death suggests that adaptive immunity and dormancy/suicide response are functionally coupled. Such coupling could manifest in the persistence state being induced and potentially providing conditions for more effective action of the immune system or in cell death being triggered when immunity fails.",
    "CSEQ-SIMULATOR: A DATA SIMULATOR FOR CLIP-SEQ EXPERIMENTS. CLIP-Seq protocols such as PAR-CLIP, HITS-CLIP or iCLIP allow a genome-wide analysis of protein-RNA interactions. For the processing of the resulting short read data, various tools are utilized. Some of these tools were specifically developed for CLIP-Seq data, whereas others were designed for the analysis of RNA-Seq data. To this date, however, it has not been assessed which of the available tools are most appropriate for the analysis of CLIP-Seq data. This is because an experimental gold standard dataset on which methods can be accessed and compared, is still not available. To address this lack of a gold-standard dataset, we here present Cseq-Simulator, a simulator for PAR-CLIP, HITS-CLIP and iCLIP-data. This simulator can be applied to generate realistic datasets that can serve as surrogates for experimental gold standard dataset. In this work, we also show how Cseq-Simulator can be used to perform a comparison of steps of typical CLIP-Seq analysis pipelines, such as the read alignment or the peak calling. These comparisons show which tools are useful in different settings and also allow identifying pitfalls in the data analysis.",
    "Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIalpha mediates activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and cytosolic phospholipase A2 in norepinephrine-induced arachidonic acid release in rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells. We have investigated the contribution of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) in norepinephrine (NE)-induced arachidonic acid (AA) release in rabbit aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). NE enhanced release of AA via activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) but not secretory PLA2 in VSMC prelabeled with [3H]AA. NE (10 microM) enhanced CaM kinase II and MAP kinase activity. In cells transiently transfected with antisense oligonucleotides complementary to the translation initiation sites of CaM kinase II and MAP kinase, NE-induced AA release was inhibited by 100 and 35% respectively. Treatment of cells with PD-098059, a MAP kinase kinase inhibitor, or with MAP kinase antisense oligonucleotide reduced NE-induced activation of MAP kinase and cPLA2. NE-induced MAP kinase and cPLA2 activation was also inhibited in cells treated with a CaM kinase II inhibitor, KN-93, or with CaM kinase II antisense oligonucleotide. On the other hand, inhibition of MAP kinase kinase with PD-098059 or of MAP kinase with antisense oligonucleotides did not alter the NE-induced increase in CaM kinase II activity. Phosphorylation of MAP kinase and CaM kinase II by NE, studied by 32P incorporation and immune complex kinase assays, was inhibited by KN-93. Collectively, these data suggest that CaM kinase II can activate MAP kinase, which in turn activates cPLA2 to release AA for prostacyclin synthesis in the rabbit VSMC. This novel pathway for activation of MAP kinase by CaM kinase II appears to be mediated through stimulation of MAP kinase kinase. Activation of adrenergic receptors with NE in VSMC caused translocation of CaM kinase II, MAP kinase, and cPLA2 to the nuclear envelope only in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Okadaic acid, which increased phosphorylation and activity, did not translocate these enzymes. Therefore, it appears that in rabbit VSMC, NE, by promoting extracellular Ca2+ influx, increases CaM kinase II activity, leading to activation of MAP kinase and cPLA2 and translocation to the nuclear envelope, resulting in release of AA from the nuclear envelope for prostacyclin synthesis.",
    "Calsequestrin targeting to sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle fibers. Calsequestrin (CS) is the low-affinity, high-capacity calcium binding protein segregated to the lumen of terminal cisternae (TC) of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The physiological role of CS in controlling calcium release from the SR depends on both its intrinsic properties and its localization. The mechanisms of CS targeting were investigated in skeletal muscle fibers and C2C12 myotubes, a model of SR differentiation, with four deletion mutants of epitope (hemagglutinin, HA)-tagged CS: CS-HA24NH2, CS-HA2D, CS-HA3D, and CS-HAHT, a double mutant of the NH2 terminus and domain III. As judged by immunofluorescence of transfected skeletal muscle fibers, only the double CS-HA mutant showed a homogeneous distribution at the sarcomeric I band, i.e., it did not segregate to TC. As shown by subfractionation of microsomes derived from transfected skeletal muscles, CS-HAHT was largely associated to longitudinal SR whereas CS-HA was concentrated in TC. In C2C12 myotubes, as judged by immunofluorescence, not only CS-HAHT but also CS-HA3D and CS-HA2D were not sorted to developing SR. Condensation competence, a property referable to CS oligomerization, was monitored for the several CS-HA mutants in C2C12 myoblasts, and only CS-HA3D was found able to condense. Together, the results indicate that 1) there are at least two targeting sequences at the NH2 terminus and domain III of CS, 2) SR-specific target and structural information is contained in these sequences, 3) heterologous interactions with junctional SR proteins are relevant for segregation, 4) homologous CS-CS interactions are involved in the overall targeting process, and 5) different targeting mechanisms prevail depending on the stage of SR differentiation.",
    "CancerSubtypes: an R/Bioconductor package for molecular cancer subtype identification, validation and visualization. Summary: Identifying molecular cancer subtypes from multi-omics data is an important step in the personalized medicine. We introduce CancerSubtypes, an R package for identifying cancer subtypes using multi-omics data, including gene expression, miRNA expression and DNA methylation data. CancerSubtypes integrates four main computational methods which are highly cited for cancer subtype identification and provides a standardized framework for data pre-processing, feature selection, and result follow-up analyses, including results computing, biology validation and visualization. The input and output of each step in the framework are packaged in the same data format, making it convenience to compare different methods. The package is useful for inferring cancer subtypes from an input genomic dataset, comparing the predictions from different well-known methods and testing new subtype discovery methods, as shown with different application scenarios in the Supplementary Material. Availability and implementation: The package is implemented in R and available under GPL-2 license from the Bioconductor website (http://bioconductor.org/packages/CancerSubtypes/).

    "Caralluma Fimbriata Supplementation Improves the Appetite Behavior of Children and Adolescents with Prader-Willi Syndrome. BACKGROUND: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) results from a deletion of the paternal genes in the region of chromosome 15q11-q13. PWS develops hyperphagia, which when left unmanaged, leads to an excessive ingestion of food. To date there is inadequate pharmacological treatment or supplementation for modification of the PWS hyperphagia and/or the associated behaviors. Therefore, the best practice is familial supervision and restriction of diet and environment. AIM: We aimed to determine if the natural supplement of Caralluma fimbriata extract (CFE) could attenuate hyperphagia or the associated appetite behaviors in children and adolescents with PWS over the 4-week pilot trial period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized crossover trial over a 10-week period to investigate the effects of CFE on hunger control, in a cohort of children and adolescents with confirmed PWS (n =15, mean age 9.27 \u00b1 3.16 years, body weight 43.98 \u00b1 23.99 kg). Participants from Australia and New Zealand ingested CFE or a placebo of maltodextrin/cabbage leaf over a 4-week period, with a 2-week washout before the crossover to the other treatment. Weekly comparisons in appetite behavior, severity, and drive were recorded by parents, as scaled time-point measures on a hyperphagia questionnaire validated for PWS. RESULTS: CFE administration was found to induce a significant accumulative easing of hyperphagia (P = 0.05), with decreases evident in one-third of the participants. Furthermore due to CFE supplementation, a significant decrease (P < 0.05) was recorded in the category of behavior and a decrease in hyperphagia (n = 8, P = 0.009) was observed at the highest dose 1,000 mg/day (recommended adult dose). There were no reported adverse effects at any dose. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that an extract of the Indian cactus succulent Caralluma fimbriata eases hyperphagic appetite behavior within a cohort of children and adolescents (n = 15) with PWS without notable adverse effects. The outcomes of this study will have a potential positive impact on PWS management.",
    "Carboxyl terminus of hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) can remodel mature aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) complexes and mediate ubiquitination of both the AhR and the 90 kDa heat-shock protein (hsp90) in vitro. The regulation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) protein levels has been an area of keen interest, given its important role in mediating the cellular adaptation and toxic response to several environmental pollutants. The carboxyl terminus of hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) ubiquitin ligase was previously associated with the regulation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, although the mechanisms were not directly demonstrated. In this study, we established that CHIP could associate with the AhR at cellular levels of these two proteins, suggesting a potential role for CHIP in the regulation of the AhR complex. The analysis of the sucrose-gradient-fractionated in vitro translated AhR complexes revealed that CHIP can mediate hsp90 ubiquitination while cooperating with unidentified factors to promote the ubiquitination of mature unliganded AhR complexes. In addition, the immunophilin-like protein XAP2 was able to partially protect the AhR from CHIP-mediated ubiquitination in vitro. This protection required the direct interaction of the XAP2 with the AhR complex. Surprisingly, CHIP silencing in Hepa-1c1c7 cells by siRNA methods did not reveal the function of CHIP in the AhR complex, because it did not affect well-characterized activities of the AhR nor affect its steady-state protein levels. However, the presence of potential compensatory mechanisms may be confounding this particular observation. Our results suggest a model where the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP cooperates with other ubiquitination factors to remodel native AhR-hsp90 complexes and where co-chaperones such as the XAP2 may affect the ability of CHIP to target AhR complexes for ubiquitination.",
    "Cardiac arrhythmias during or after epileptic seizures. Seizure-related cardiac arrhythmias are frequently reported and have been implicated as potential pathomechanisms of Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). We attempted to identify clinical profiles associated with various (post)ictal cardiac arrhythmias. We conducted a systematic search from the first date available to July 2013 on the combination of two terms: 'cardiac arrhythmias' and 'epilepsy'. The databases searched were PubMed, Embase (OVID version), Web of Science and COCHRANE Library. We attempted to identify all case reports and case series. We identified seven distinct patterns of (post)ictal cardiac arrhythmias: ictal asystole (103 cases), postictal asystole (13 cases), ictal bradycardia (25 cases), ictal atrioventricular (AV)-conduction block (11 cases), postictal AV-conduction block (2 cases), (post)ictal atrial flutter/atrial fibrillation (14 cases) and postictal ventricular fibrillation (3 cases). Ictal asystole had a mean prevalence of 0.318% (95% CI 0.316% to 0.320%) in people with refractory epilepsy who underwent video-EEG monitoring. Ictal asystole, bradycardia and AV-conduction block were self-limiting in all but one of the cases and seen during focal dyscognitive seizures. Seizure onset was mostly temporal (91%) without consistent lateralisation. Postictal arrhythmias were mostly found following convulsive seizures and often associated with (near) SUDEP. The contrasting clinical profiles of ictal and postictal arrhythmias suggest different pathomechanisms. Postictal rather than ictal arrhythmias seem of greater importance to the pathophysiology of SUDEP.",
    "Cardiac conduction disorders in children. Conduction disorders result in cardiac arrhythmias that may be fatal. Histiocytoid cardiomyopathy, Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, Isolated noncompaction of the left ventricle, Long QT syndrome (LQTS) and Brugada syndrome, are all well described. Congenital short QT syndrome is a new familial primary electrical disease of the heart, which is characterized by abnormally short QT interval and paroxysmal atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including sudden cardiac death. An autosomal dominant mode of inheritance has been suggested. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is an inherited disease and occurs in the absence of structural heart disease or known associated syndromes. Although the histological appearance of some of these disorders may be diagnostic, molecular analysis is necessary to define clearly the particular type of cardiomyopathy.",
    "Caring for a patient with rabies: implications of the Milwaukee protocol for infection control and public health measures. This article discusses the infection control and public health measures taken whilst managing a case of laboratory-confirmed rabies, and the challenges faced in implementing these measures. Case management requires intensive multi-disciplinary co-ordination. The Milwaukee protocol, which to date has five reported human rabies survivors associated with its use, has been suggested as a potential management pathway for human rabies. Consensus among hospital and public health clinicians would aid future deployment of this approach in selected cases.",
    "Cathepsin A regulates chaperone-mediated autophagy through cleavage of the lysosomal receptor. Protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA) has a serine carboxypeptidase activity of unknown physiological function. We now demonstrate that this protease activity triggers the degradation of the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2a (lamp2a), a receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). Degradation of lamp2a is important because its level in the lysosomal membrane is a rate-limiting step of CMA. Cells defective in PPCA show reduced rates of lamp2a degradation, higher levels of lamp2a and higher rates of CMA. Restoration of PPCA protease activity increases rates of lamp2a degradation, reduces levels of lysosomal lamp2a and reduces rates of CMA. PPCA associates with lamp2a on the lysosomal membrane and cleaves lamp2a near the boundary between the luminal and transmembrane domains. In addition to the well-studied role of PPCA in targeting and protecting two lysosomal glycosidases, we have defined a role for the proteolytic activity of this multifunctional protein.",
    "Cell-cycle regulation of cohesin stability along fission yeast chromosomes. Sister chromatid cohesion is mediated by cohesin, but the process of cohesion establishment during S-phase is still enigmatic. In mammalian cells, cohesin binding to chromatin is dynamic in G1, but becomes stabilized during S-phase. Whether the regulation of cohesin stability is integral to the process of cohesion establishment is unknown. Here, we provide evidence that fission yeast cohesin also displays dynamic behavior. Cohesin association with G1 chromosomes requires continued activity of the cohesin loader Mis4/Ssl3, suggesting that repeated loading cycles maintain cohesin binding. Cohesin instability in G1 depends on wpl1, the fission yeast ortholog of mammalian Wapl, suggestive of a conserved mechanism that controls cohesin stability on chromosomes. wpl1 is nonessential, indicating that a change in wpl1-dependent cohesin dynamics is dispensable for cohesion establishment. Instead, we find that cohesin stability increases at the time of S-phase in a reaction that can be uncoupled from DNA replication. Hence, cohesin stabilization might be a pre-requisite for cohesion establishment rather than its consequence.",
    "Cellular or Exosomal microRNAs Associated with CCN Gene Expression in Liver Fibrosis. Liver fibrosis occurs during chronic injury and represents, in large part, an exaggerated matrigenic output by hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) which become activated as a result of injury-induced signaling pathways in parenchymal and inflammatory cells (hepatocytes, macrophages, etc.). The molecular components in these pathways (e.g., CCN proteins) are modulated by transcription factors as well as by factors such as microRNAs (miRs) that act posttranscriptionally. MiRs are small (~23 nt) noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by specifically interacting with the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target gene mRNA to repress translation or enhance mRNA cleavage. As well as acting in their cells of production, miRs (and other cellular constituents such as mRNAs and proteins) can be liberated from their cells of origin in nanovesicular membrane exosomes, which traverse the intercellular spaces, and can be delivered to neighboring cells into which they release their molecular payload, causing alterations in gene expression in the target cells. Here we summarize some of the experimental approaches for studying miR action and exosomal trafficking between hepatic cells. Insights into the mechanisms involved will yield new information about how hepatic fibrosis is regulated and, further, may identify new points of therapeutic intervention.",
    "Chaperone-mediated autophagy components are upregulated in sporadic inclusion-body myositis muscle fibres. AIMS: Sporadic inclusion-body myositis (s-IBM) is an age-associated degenerative muscle disease. Characteristic features are muscle-fibre vacuolization and intramuscle-fibre accumulations of multiprotein aggregates, which may result from the demonstrated impairments of the 26S proteasome and autophagy. Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a selective form of lysosomal degradation targeting proteins carrying the KFERQ motif. Lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP2A) and the heat-shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) constitute specific CMA components. Neither CMA components nor CMA activity has been studied in normal or disease human muscle, to our knowledge. METHODS: We studied CMA components by immunocytochemistry, immunoblots, real-time PCR and immunoprecipitation in: (a) 16 s-IBM, nine aged-matched normal and nine disease control muscle biopsies; and (b) cultured human muscle fibres (CHMFs) with experimentally inhibited activities of either the 26S proteasome or autophagy. RESULTS: Compared with age-matched controls, in s-IBM muscle, LAMP2A and Hsc70 were on a given transverse section accumulated as aggregates in approximately 5% of muscle fibres, where they (a) colocalized with each other and \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn), a CMA-targeted protein; and (b) were bound to each other and to \u03b1-syn by immunoprecipitation. By immunoblots, LAMP2A was increased sevenfold P < 0.001 and Hsc70 2.6-fold P < 0.05. LAMP2A mRNA was increased 4.4-fold P < 0.001 and Hsc70 mRNA 1.9-fold P < 0.05. In CHMFs inhibition of either the 26S proteasome or autophagy induced CMA, evidenced by a significant increase of both LAMP2A and Hsc70. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates, for the first time, up-regulation of CMA components in s-IBM muscle, and it provides further evidence that altered protein degradation is likely an important pathogenic aspect in s-IBM.",
    "Characterisation of inflammatory response, coagulation, and radiological findings in Katayama fever: a report of three cases at the Medical University of Vienna, Austria. BACKGROUND: Katayama fever is an acute clinical condition characterised by high fever, dry cough and general malaise occurring during early Schistosoma spp. infection. It is predominantly reported in travellers from non-endemic regions. Whereas the immunological response to Schistosoma infection is well characterised, alterations in inflammatory markers and coagulation in response to acute infection are poorly understood. METHODS: Here we report the clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics of three returning travellers with Katayama fever. Inflammatory markers and coagulation status were assessed repeatedly during follow-up to characterise the host response to infection. Radiographic findings were correlated with clinical and laboratory markers. RESULTS: Clinical symptoms were suggestive of a significant inflammatory response in all patients including high fever (>39\u00b0C), cough, and general malaise. Classical inflammatory markers including blood sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and serum amyloid A were only moderately elevated. Marked eosinophilia (33-42% of white blood cells) was observed and persisted despite anti-inflammatory and anthelminthic treatment for up to 32 weeks. Analysis of blood coagulation markers indicated increased coagulability reflected by elevated D-dimer values (0.57-1.17 \u03bcg/ml) and high thrombin generating potentials (peak thrombin activity: 311-384 nM). One patient showed particularly high levels of microparticle-associated tissue factor activity at initial presentation (1.64 pg/ml). Multiple pulmonary and hepatic opacities demonstrated by computed tomography (CT) scanning were associated with raised inflammatory markers in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: The characterisation of the inflammatory response, blood coagulation parameters and radiological findings in three patients adds to our current understanding of Katayama fever and serves as a starting point for further systematic investigations of the pathophysiology of this acute helminthic infection.",
    "Characterization of mammalian selenoproteomes. In the genetic code, UGA serves as a stop signal and a selenocysteine codon, but no computational methods for identifying its coding function are available. Consequently, most selenoprotein genes are misannotated. We identified selenoprotein genes in sequenced mammalian genomes by methods that rely on identification of selenocysteine insertion RNA structures, the coding potential of UGA codons, and the presence of cysteine-containing homologs. The human selenoproteome consists of 25 selenoproteins.",
    "Characterization of three kindreds with familial combined hypolipidemia caused by loss-of-function mutations of ANGPTL3. BACKGROUND: Angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) affects lipid metabolism by inhibiting the activity of lipoprotein and endothelial lipases. Angptl3 knockout mice have marked hypolipidemia, and heterozygous carriers of ANGPLT3, loss-of-function mutations were found among individuals in the lowest quartile of plasma triglycerides in population studies. Recently, 4 related individuals with primary hypolipidemia were found to be compound heterozygotes for ANGPTL3 loss-of-function mutations. METHODS AND RESULTS: We resequenced ANGPTL3 in 4 members of 3 kindreds originally identified for very low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.97\u00b10.16 and 0.56\u00b10.20 mmol/L, respectively) in whom no mutations of known candidate genes for monogenic hypobetalipoproteinemia and hypoalphalipoproteinemia had been detected. These subjects were found to be homozygous or compound heterozygous for ANGPTL3 loss-of-function mutations (p.G400VfsX5, p.I19LfsX22/p.N147X) associated with the absence of ANGPTL3 in plasma. They had reduced plasma levels of triglyceride-containing lipoproteins and of HDL particles that contained only apolipoprotein A-I and pre-\u03b2-high-density lipoprotein. In addition, their apolipoprotein B-depleted sera had a reduced capacity to promote cell cholesterol efflux through the various pathways (ABCA1-, SR-BI-, and ABCG1-mediated efflux); however, these subjects had no clinical evidence of accelerated atherosclerosis. Heterozygous carriers of the ANGPTL3 mutations had low plasma ANGPTL3 and moderately reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (2.52\u00b10.38 mmol/L) but normal plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS: Complete ANGPTL3 deficiency caused by loss-of-function mutations of ANGPTL3 is associated with a recessive hypolipidemia characterized by a reduction of apolipoprotein B and apolipoprotein A-I-containing lipoproteins, changes in subclasses of high-density lipoprotein, and reduced cholesterol efflux potential of serum. Partial ANGPTL3 deficiency is associated only with a moderate reduction of low-density lipoprotein.",
    "Chicken trunk neural crest migration visualized with HNK1. The development of the nervous system involves cells remaining within the neural tube (CNS) and a group of cells that delaminate from the dorsal neural tube and migrate extensively throughout the developing embryo called neural crest cells (NCC). These cells are a mesenchymal highly migratory group of cells that give rise to a wide variety of cell derivatives: melanocytes, sensory neurons, bone, Schwann cells, etc. But not all NCC can give rise to all derivatives, they have fate restrictions based on their axial level of origin: cranial, vagal, trunk and sacral. Our aim was to provide a thorough presentation on how does trunk neural crest cell migration looks in the chicken embryo, in wholemount and in sections using the unique chicken marker HNK1. The description presented here makes a good guideline for those interested in viewing trunk NCC migration patterns. We show how before HH14 there are few trunk NCC delaminating and migrating, but between HH15 through HH19 trunk NCC delaminate in large numbers. Melanocytes precursors begin to enter the dorsolateral pathway by HH17. We found that by HH20 HNK1 is not a valid good marker for NCC and that HNK1 is a better marker than Sox10 when looking at neural crest cells morphology and migration details.",
    "Chromosomal mobilization and reintegration of Sleeping Beauty and PiggyBac transposons. The Sleeping Beauty and PiggyBac DNA transposon systems have recently been developed as tools for insertional mutagenesis. We have compared the chromosomal mobilization efficiency and insertion site preference of the two transposons mobilized from the same donor site in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells under conditions in which there were no selective constraints on the transposons' insertion sites. Compared with Sleeping Beauty, PiggyBac exhibits higher transposition efficiencies, no evidence for local hopping and a significant bias toward reintegration in intragenic regions, which demonstrate its utility for insertional mutagenesis. Although Sleeping Beauty had no detectable genomic bias with respect to insertions in genes or intergenic regions, both Sleeping Beauty and PiggyBac transposons displayed preferential integration into actively transcribed loci.",
    "Chromosome XII context is important for rDNA function in yeast. The rDNA cluster in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is located 450 kb from the left end and 610 kb from the right end of chromosome XII and consists of approximately 150 tandemly repeated copies of a 9.1 kb rDNA unit. To explore the biological significance of this specific chromosomal context, chromosome XII was split at both sides of the rDNA cluster and strains harboring deleted variants of chromosome XII consisting of 450 kb, 1500 kb (rDNA cluster only) and 610 kb were created. In the strain harboring the 1500 kb variant of chromosome XII consisting solely of rDNA, the size of the rDNA cluster was found to decrease as a result of a decrease in rDNA copy number. The frequency of silencing of URA3 inserted within the rDNA locus was found to be greater than in a wild-type strain. The localization and morphology of the nucleolus was also affected such that a single and occasionally (6-12% frequency) two foci for Nop1p and a rounded nucleolus were observed, whereas a typical crescent-shaped nucleolar structure was seen in the wild-type strain. Notably, strains harboring the 450 kb chromosome XII variant and/or the 1500 kb variant consisting solely of rDNA had shorter life spans than wild type and also accumulated extrachromosomal rDNA circles. These observations suggest that the context of chromosome XII plays an important role in maintaining a constant rDNA copy number and in physiological processes related to rDNA function in S.cerevisiae.",
    "Circular RNA: A new star of noncoding RNAs. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel type of RNA that, unlike linear RNAs, form a covalently closed continuous loop and are highly represented in the eukaryotic transcriptome. Recent studies have discovered thousands of endogenous circRNAs in mammalian cells. CircRNAs are largely generated from exonic or intronic sequences, and reverse complementary sequences or RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are necessary for circRNA biogenesis. The majority of circRNAs are conserved across species, are stable and resistant to RNase R, and often exhibit tissue/developmental-stage-specific expression. Recent research has revealed that circRNAs can function as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, regulators of splicing and transcription, and modifiers of parental gene expression. Emerging evidence indicates that circRNAs might play important roles in atherosclerotic vascular disease risk, neurological disorders, prion diseases and cancer; exhibit aberrant expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC); and serve as diagnostic or predictive biomarkers of some diseases. Similar to miRNAs and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), circRNAs are becoming a new research hotspot in the field of RNA and could be widely involved in the processes of life. Herein, we review the formation and properties of circRNAs, their functions, and their potential significance in disease.",
    "Clinical correlates of 'BRCAness' in triple-negative breast cancer of patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. BACKGROUND: We have previously reported an array comparative genomic hybridization profile that identifies triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC), with BRCA1 dysfunction and a high sensitivity to intensified dose bifunctional alkylating agents. To determine the effect of conventional-dose chemotherapy in patients with this so-called BRCA1-like profile, clinical characteristics and survival were studied in a large group of TNBC patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: DNA was isolated and BRCA1-like status was assessed in 101 patients with early-stage TNBC receiving adjuvant cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy. Clinical characteristics and survival were compared between BRCA1-like and non-BRCA1-like groups. Results Sixty-six tumors (65%) had a BRCA1-like profile. Patients with BRCA1-like tumors tended to be younger and had more often node-negative disease (P = 0.06 and P = 0.03, respectively). Five-year recurrence-free survival was 80% for the BRCA1-like group and 75% for the non-BRCA1-like group (P = 0.35). T stage was the only variable significantly associated with survival. CONCLUSIONS: BRCA1-like tumors share clinical features, like young age at diagnosis and similar nodal status, with breast cancers in BRCA1 mutation carriers. Their prognosis is similar to that of non-BRCA1-like tumors when conventional-dose chemotherapy is administered. TNBCs that are classified as BRCA1-like may contain a defect in homologous recombination and could, in theory, benefit from the addition of poly ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors.",
    "Clinical decision support increases diagnostic yield of computed tomography for suspected pulmonary embolism. OBJECTIVE: Determine effects of evidence-based clinical decision support (CDS) on the use and yield of computed tomographic pulmonary angiography for suspected pulmonary embolism (CTPE) in Emergency Department (ED) patients. METHODS: This multi-site prospective quality improvement intervention conducted in three urban EDs used a pre/post design. For ED patients aged 18+years with suspected PE, CTPE use and yield were compared 19months pre- and 32months post-implementation of CDS intervention based on the Wells criteria, provided at the time of CTPE order, deployed in April 2012. Primary outcome was the yield (percentage of studies positive for acute PE). Secondary outcome was utilization (number of studies/100 ED visits) of CTPE. Chi-square and statistical process control chart assessed pre- and post-intervention differences. An interrupted time series analysis was also performed. RESULTS: Of 558,795 patients presenting October 2010-December 2014, 7987 (1.4%) underwent CTPE (mean age 52\u00b117.5years, 66% female, 60.1% black); 34.7% of patients presented pre- and 65.3% post-CDS implementation. Overall CTPE diagnostic yield was 9.8% (779/7987 studies positive for PE). Yield increased a relative 30.8% after CDS implementation (8.1% vs. 10.6%; p=0.0003). There was no statistically significant change in CTPE utilization (1.4% pre- vs. 1.4% post-implementation; p=0.25). A statistical process control chart demonstrated immediate and sustained improvement in CTPE yield post-implementation. Interrupted time series analysis demonstrated the slope of PE findings versus time to be unchanged before and after the intervention (p=0.9). However, there was a trend that the intervention was associated with a 50% increased probability of PE finding (p=0.08), suggesting an immediate rather than gradual change after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing evidence-based CDS in the ED was associated with an immediate, significant and sustained increase in CTPE yield without a measurable decrease in CTPE utilization. Further studies will be needed to assess whether stronger interventions could further improve appropriate use of CTPE.",
    "Clinical perspective of afatinib in non-small cell lung cancer. Reversible ATP-competitive inhibitors targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been established as the most effective treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring \"activating\" mutations in exons 19 and 21 of the EGFR gene. However, clinical activity is limited by acquired resistance which on average develops within 10 months of continued treatment. The mechanisms for acquired resistance include selection of the EGFR T790M mutation in approximately 50% of cases, and MET gene amplification, PIK3CA gene mutation, transdifferentiation into small-cell lung cancer and additional rare or unkown mechanisms. Afatinib is a small molecule covalently binding and inhibiting the EGFR, HER2 and HER4 receptor tyrosine kinases. In preclinical studies, afatinib not only inhibited the growth of models with common activating EGFR mutations, but was also active in lung cancer models harboring wild-type EGFR or the EGFR L858R/T790M double mutant. Clinical efficacy of afatinib has been extensively studied in the LUX-Lung study program. These trials showed promising efficacy in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC or enriched for clinical benefit from EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib or erlotinib. Here we review the current status of clinical application of afatinib in NSCLC. We also discuss clinical aspects of resistance to afatinib and strategies for its circumvention.",
    "Clinical, electrophysiologic and pathologic findings in 10 patients with myotonic dystrophy 2. BACKGROUND: Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is an autosomal dominant, multisystem disorder caused by a CCTG tetranucleotide repeat expansion located in intron 1 of the zinc finger protein 9 gene (ZNF9 gene) on chromosome 3q 21.3. OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical, electrophysiologic and pathologic findings in patients with myotonic dystrophy 2. METHODS: We evaluated 10 patients genetically, clinically and electrophysiologically during the years 2007 to 2008. RESULTS: All patients were of Jewish European ancestry. Among affected individuals, eight patients had symptoms of proximal muscle weakness, two had muscle pain, and two exhibited myotonia. On physical examination six patients had severe weakness of hip flexor muscles. Seven individuals underwent cataract surgery, and cardiac involvement was seen in one case. On the initial electromyographic (EMG) examination five patients demonstrated myotonic discharges; repeated studies showed these discharges in nine cases. Six muscle biopsies showed non-specific pathological changes. Seven patients had an affected first-degree relative with either a diagnosed or an undiagnosed muscular disorder consistent with an autosomal dominant trait. CONCLUSIONS: DM2 may often present with proximal muscle weakness without myotonia. EMG may initially fail to show myotonic discharges, but these discharges may eventually show in most cases on repeated EMG. Thus, DM2 may be underdiagnosed and should be included in the differential diagnosis of adult patients of Jewish European ancestry presenting with proximal lower limb weakness.",
    "Clinics in diagnostic imaging (175). Corpus callosum glioblastoma multiforme (GBM): butterfly glioma. A 54-year-old man presented with change in behaviour, nocturnal enuresis, abnormal limb movement and headache of one week's duration. The diagnosis of butterfly glioma (glioblastoma multiforme) was made based on imaging characteristics and was further confirmed by biopsy findings. As the corpus callosum is usually resistant to infiltration by tumours, a mass that involves and crosses the corpus callosum is suggestive of an aggressive neoplasm. Other neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions that may involve the corpus callosum and mimic a butterfly glioma, as well as associated imaging features, are discussed.",
    "Co-amplification of MYCN and a DEAD box gene (DDX1) in primary neuroblastoma. DEAD box proteins are putative RNA helicases that have been implicated in cellular processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure, such as translation initiation and splicing. These proteins share eight conserved amino acid motifs, including Asp(D)-Glu-(E)-Ala(A)-Asp(D) which is part of a more extended motif. Recently, we have shown that the novel DDX1 gene containing a DEAD box motif maps to the same chromosome band as MYCN at 2p24 and is co-amplified with MYCN in retinoblastoma cell lines. Here, we show that the DDX1 gene is co-amplified with the MYCN gene in 2 of three neuroblastoma cell lines and that DDX1 RNA levels correlate with DDX1 gene copy number. Since amplification of MYCN is an indicator of poor prognosis in neuroblastoma, it was of interest to determine whether co-amplification with DDX1 occurred in clinical samples of neuroblastoma and whether such a finding carried any additional prognostic significance. We determined the gene copy number of DDX1 in 32 neuroblastoma patient samples (representative of all stages): 13 were MYCN amplified and 19 had normal copy numbers of the MYCN gene. Of the 13 neuroblastomas that were MYCN amplified, seven were also DDX1 amplified. Of the 19 that were not MYCN amplified, none were DDX1 amplified. This is the first example of a gene that is co-amplified with MYCN at a high frequency in neuroblastoma. While there was a trend towards a worse clinical outcome with co-amplification, the numbers were too small to reach significance.",
    "Cognitive abilities of Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice are modulated by social context and circadian rhythm. In the present study, we used a new training paradigm in the intelliCage automatic behavioral assessment system to investigate cognitive functions of the transgenic mice harboring London mutation of the human amyloid precursor protein (APP.V717I). Three groups of animals: 5-, 12- and 18-24-month old were subjected to both Water Maze training and the IntelliCage-based appetitive conditioning. The spatial memory deficit was observed in all three groups of transgenic mice in both behavioral paradigms. However, the APP mice were capable to learn normally when co-housed with the wild-type (WT) littermates, in contrast to clearly impaired learning observed when the transgenic mice were housed alone. Furthermore, in the transgenic mice kept in the Intellicage alone, the cognitive deficit of the young animals was modulated by the circadian rhythm, namely was prominent only during the active phase of the day. The novel approach to study the transgenic mice cognitive abilities presented in this paper offers new insight into cognitive dysfunctions of the Alzheimer's disease mouse model.",
    "Coilin displays differential affinity for specific RNAs in vivo and is linked to telomerase RNA biogenesis. Coilin is widely known as the protein marker of the Cajal body, a subnuclear domain important to the biogenesis of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins and telomerase, complexes that are crucial to pre-messenger RNA splicing and telomere maintenance, respectively. Extensive studies have characterized the interaction between coilin and the various other protein components of CBs and related subnuclear domains; however, only a few have examined interactions between coilin and nucleic acid. We have recently published that coilin is tightly associated with nucleic acid, displays RNase activity in vitro, and is redistributed to the ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-rich nucleoli in cells treated with the DNA-damaging agents cisplatin and etoposide. Here, we report a specific in vivo association between coilin and rRNA, U small nuclear RNA (snRNA), and human telomerase RNA, which is altered upon treatment with DNA-damaging agents. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we provide evidence of coilin interaction with specific regions of U snRNA gene loci. We have also utilized bacterially expressed coilin fragments in order to map the region(s) important for RNA binding and RNase activity in vitro. Additionally, we provide evidence of coilin involvement in the processing of human telomerase RNA both in vitro and in vivo.",
    "Communicating hydrocephalus following eosinophilic meningitis is pathogenic for chronic Viliuisk encephalomyelitis in Northeastern Siberia. BACKGROUND: Viliuisk encephalomyelitis (VE) is an endemic neurological disease in Northeast Siberia and generally considered to be a chronic encephalomyelitis of unknown origin actually spreading in the Sakha (Yakutian) Republic. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: In search for the pathophysiology and causative agent of VE, we performed a cross-sectional study on clinical, serological and neuroimaging data on chronic VE patients during two medical expeditions to three villages within the Viliuiski river basin in the Republic of Sakha in 2000 and to the capital Yakutsk in 2006. The severity of the core clinical picture with predominant sensory ataxia, gait apraxia, lower limb spasticity, cognitive impairment and bladder dysfunction correlated with the degree of MRI findings showing enlargement of inner ventricular spaces as in communicating hydrocephalus. Laboratory studies revealed transient eosinophilia during the preceding acute meningitis-like phase, but no ongoing inflammatory process in the CSF. We found immune reactions against Toxocara canis in the majority of chronic VE patients but rarely in controls (P = 0.025; Fisher's exact test). Histological analysis of subacute to subchronic VE brain samples showed eosinophilic infiltrations with no signs of persistent Toxocara canis infection. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Our data showed that pressure by the communicating hydrocephalus as a mechanical factor is the major pathogenic mechanism in chronic VE, most likely triggered by eosinophilic meningitis. There are no signs for an ongoing inflammatory process in chronic VE. The past eosinophilic reaction in VE might be caused by Toxocara ssp. infection and might therefore represent the first hint for an initial cause leading to the development of chronic VE. Our data provide a framework for future studies and potential therapeutic interventions for this enigmatic epidemic neurological disease potentially spreading in Sakha Republic.",
    "Comparing the incidence of bone tumors in rats chronically exposed\u00a0to the selective PTH type 1 receptor agonist abaloparatide\u00a0or\u00a0PTH(1-34). Prolonged treatment with human parathyroid hormone (hPTH) in rats results in development of bone tumors, though this finding has not been supported by clinical experience. The PTH type 1 receptor agonist abaloparatide, selected for its bone anabolic activity, is under clinical development to treat postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. To determine the carcinogenic potential of abaloparatide, Fischer (F344) rats were administered SC daily abaloparatide at doses of 0, 10, 25, and 50\u00a0\u03bcg/kg or 30\u00a0\u03bcg/kg hPTH(1-34) as a positive control for up to 2 years. Robust increases in bone density were achieved at all abaloparatide doses and with hPTH(1-34). Comprehensive histopathological analysis reflected a comparable continuum of proliferative changes in bone, mostly osteosarcoma, in both abaloparatide and hPTH(1-34) treated rats. Comparing the effects of abaloparatide and hPTH(1-34) at the 25 and 30\u00a0\u03bcg/kg respective doses, representing similar exposure multiples to the human therapeutic doses, revealed similar osteosarcoma-associated mortality, tumor incidence, age at first occurrence, and metastatic potential. There were no increases in the incidence of non-bone tumors with abaloparatide compared to vehicle. Thus, near life-long treatment with abaloparatide in rats resulted in dose and time dependent formation of osteosarcomas, with a comparable response to hPTH(1-34) at similar exposure.",
    "Complete OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 deficiency causes human Rotor syndrome by interrupting conjugated bilirubin reuptake into the liver. Bilirubin, a breakdown product of heme, is normally glucuronidated and excreted by the liver into bile. Failure of this system can lead to a buildup of conjugated bilirubin in the blood, resulting in jaundice. The mechanistic basis of bilirubin excretion and hyperbilirubinemia syndromes is largely understood, but that of Rotor syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, coproporphyrinuria, and near-absent hepatic uptake of anionic diagnostics, has remained enigmatic. Here, we analyzed 8 Rotor-syndrome families and found that Rotor syndrome was linked to mutations predicted to cause complete and simultaneous deficiencies of the organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. These important detoxification-limiting proteins mediate uptake and clearance of countless drugs and drug conjugates across the sinusoidal hepatocyte membrane. OATP1B1 polymorphisms have previously been linked to drug hypersensitivities. Using mice deficient in Oatp1a/1b and in the multispecific sinusoidal export pump Abcc3, we found that Abcc3 secretes bilirubin conjugates into the blood, while Oatp1a/1b transporters mediate their hepatic reuptake. Transgenic expression of human OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 restored the function of this detoxification-enhancing liver-blood shuttle in Oatp1a/1b-deficient mice. Within liver lobules, this shuttle may allow flexible transfer of bilirubin conjugates (and probably also drug conjugates) formed in upstream hepatocytes to downstream hepatocytes, thereby preventing local saturation of further detoxification processes and hepatocyte toxic injury. Thus, disruption of hepatic reuptake of bilirubin glucuronide due to coexisting OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 deficiencies explains Rotor-type hyperbilirubinemia. Moreover, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 null mutations may confer substantial drug toxicity risks.",
    "Compound heterozygous mutations in KvLQT1 cause Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome. Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) is characterized by sensorineural deafness, QT prolongation, abnormal T waves, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and autosomal recessive inheritance. Previously homozygous mutations in the potassium channel-encoding genes, KvLQT1 (alpha-subunit) and KCNE1 (beta-subunit), have been described in consanguineous families with JLNS. We screened two nonconsanguineous families with JLNS for mutations in KvLQT1, using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, and DNA sequencing. In one family, a missense mutation was identified in exon 6 of KvLQT1 on the maternal side, resulting in a glycine to aspartic acid substitution at codon 269 (G269D). The apparently normal father had an incompletely penetrant missense mutation in exon 3 of KvLQT1, introducing a premature stop codon at position 171. In the other family, a missense mutation resulting in the substitution of asparagine for aspartic acid at codon 202 (D202N) was identified in the mother and maternal grandmother, who had QTc prolongation (borderline in the mother), while the father and paternal grandfather, who were clinically normal, had a deletion of nucleotide 585, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. In both families, the proband inherited both mutations. In this report we provide evidence that not only homozygous but also compound heterozygous mutations in KvLQT1 may cause JLNS in nonconsanguineous families. Incomplete penetrance in individuals with mutations appears to be frequent, indicating a higher prevalence of mutations than estimated previously. Interestingly, mutations resulting in truncation of the protein appear to be benign, with heterozygous carriers being asymptomatic.",
    "Considerations on a mutation in the NOTCH3 gene sparing a cysteine residue: a rare polymorphism rather than a CADASIL variant. Some missense mutations and small deletions in the NOTCH3 gene, not involving cysteine residues, have been described in patients considered to be affected by paucisymptomatic CADASIL. However, the significance of such molecular variants is still unclear. We describe a 49-year-old woman with a CADASIL-like phenotype, carrying a novel cysteine-sparing mutation in exon 29 of the NOTCH3 gene, and discuss the possible pathogenetic role of this molecular variant. Even though atypical clinical and MRI findings make a diagnosis of CADASIL unlikely in this patient, our report nevertheless underlines the intriguing genotype-phenotype relationship in NOTCH3 mutations and the importance of functional investigation to ascertain the role of new NOTCH3 mutations in CADASIL pathogenesis.",
    "Corticosteroid injection for de Quervain's tenosynovitis. BACKGROUND: De Quervain's tenosynovitis is a disorder characterised by pain on the radial (thumb) side of the wrist and functional disability of the hand. It can be treated by corticosteroid injection, splinting and surgery. OBJECTIVES: To summarise evidence on the efficacy and safety of corticosteroid injections for de Quervain's tenosynovitis. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2009), EMBASE (1956 to April 2009), CINAHL (1982 to April 2009), AMED (1985 to April 2009), DARE, Dissertation Abstracts and PEDro (physiotherapy evidence database). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and controlled clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of corticosteroid injections for de Quervain's tenosynovitis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: After screening abstracts of studies identified by the search we obtained full text articles of studies which fulfilled the selection criteria. We extracted data using a predefined electronic form. We assessed the methodological quality of included trials by using the checklist developed by Jadad and the Delphi list. We extracted data on the primary outcome measures: treatment success; severity of pain or tenderness at the radial styloid; functional impairment of the wrist or hand; and outcome of Finkelstein's test, and the secondary outcome measures: proportion of patients with side effects; type of side effects and patient satisfaction with injection treatment. MAIN RESULTS: We found one controlled clinical trial of 18 participants (all pregnant or lactating women) that compared one steroid injection with methylprednisolone and bupivacaine to splinting with a thumb spica. All patients in the steroid injection group (9/9) achieved complete relief of pain whereas none of the patients in the thumb spica group (0/9) had complete relief of pain, one to six days after intervention (number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 1.2). No side effects or local complications of steroid injection were noted. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of corticosteroid injections for de Quervain's tenosynovitis has been studied in only one small controlled clinical trial, which found steroid injections to be superior to thumb spica splinting. However, the applicability of our findings to daily clinical practice is limited, as they are based on only one trial with a small number of included participants, the methodological quality was poor and only pregnant and lactating women participated in the study. No adverse effects were observed.",
    "Cost-effectiveness of 5-aminolevulinic acid-induced fluorescence in malignant glioma surgery. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA, Gliolan\u00ae) in patients undergoing surgery for malignant glioma, in standard clinical practice conditions in Spain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cost-effectiveness ratios were determined in terms of incremental cost per complete resection (CR) and incremental cost per additional quality-adjusted life year (QALY), based on data collected in the VISIONA observational study. RESULTS: Incremental cost with 5-ALA versus conventional surgery using white light only amounts to \u20ac 4550 per additional CR achieved and \u20ac 9021 per QALY gained. A sensitivity analysis shows these results to be robust. CONCLUSION: Malignant glioma surgery guided by 5-ALA fluorescence entails a moderate increase in hospital costs compared to current surgical practice and can be considered a cost-effective innovation.",

    "Critical roles of the mitochondrial complex II in oocyst formation of rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei. It is generally accepted that the mitochondria play central roles in energy production of most eukaryotes. In contrast, it has been thought that Plasmodium spp., the causative agent of malaria, rely mainly on cytosolic glycolysis but not mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for energy production during blood stages. However, Plasmodium spp. possesses all genes necessary for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and most of the genes for electron transport chain (ETC) enzymes. Therefore, it remains elusive whether oxidative phosphorylation is essential for the parasite survival. To elucidate the role of TCA metabolism and ETC in malaria parasites, we deleted the gene for flavoprotein (Fp) subunit, Pbsdha, one of four components of complex II, a catalytic subunit for succinate dehydrogenase activity. The Pbsdha(-) parasite grew normally at blood stages in mouse. In contrast, ookinete formation of Pbsdha(-) parasites in the mosquito stage was severely impaired. Finally, Pbsdha(-) ookinetes failed in oocyst formation, leading to complete malaria transmission blockade. These results suggest that malaria parasite may switch the energy metabolism from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation to adapt to the insect vector where glucose is not readily available for ATP production.",
    "Crohn's disease: influence of age at diagnosis on site and clinical type of disease. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Crohn's disease has a bimodal age distribution of disease onset diagnosis. The peaks (20 and 50 years) may represent different phenotypes or different genetic and/or environmental influences between younger- and older-onset individuals. The aim of this study was to examine the influences of age at diagnosis of Crohn's disease on disease site, type, and course. METHODS: Records of 552 consecutive patients with Crohn's disease were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Younger age at diagnosis (younger than 20 years), compared with an older age (40 years or older), was associated with a greater prevalence of a family history of Crohn's disease (29.9% vs. 13.6%), greater small bowel involvement (88.7% vs. 57.5%), more stricturing disease (45.8% vs. 28.8%), and a higher frequency of surgery (70.6% vs. 55.3%). Older age at diagnosis was associated with a greater prevalence of colonic disease (84.8% vs. 71.2%) and the inflammatory subtype (54.5% vs. 34.4%). A conditional logistic regression analysis confirmed an independent effect of age at diagnosis on ileal disease and surgery for intractable disease. CONCLUSIONS: In Crohn's disease, early age at diagnosis is associated with more complicated disease and a greater likelihood of having affected relatives. Stratification of Crohn's disease by age at diagnosis provides support for the concept of genetic heterogeneity.",
    "Cross-talk between sympathetic neurons and adipocytes in coculture. White adipose tissue plays an integral role in energy metabolism and is governed by endocrine, autocrine, and neural signals. Neural control of adipose metabolism is mediated by sympathetic neurons that innervate the tissue. To investigate the effects of this innervation, an ex vivo system was developed in which 3T3-L1 adipocytes are cocultured with sympathetic neurons isolated from the superior cervical ganglia of newborn rats. In coculture, both adipocytes and neurons exhibit appropriate morphology, express cell-type-specific markers, and modulate key metabolic processes in one another. Lipolysis (stimulated by beta-adrenergic agents) and leptin secretion by adipocytes are down-regulated by neurons in coculture, effects apparently mediated by neuropeptide Y (NPY). Secretion of NPY by neurons is up-regulated dramatically by the presence of adipocytes in coculture and appears to be mediated by an adipocyte-derived soluble factor. Insulin, an antilipolytic agent, down-regulates NPY secretion. Our findings suggest that an adipocyte-derived factor(s) up-regulates the secretion of NPY by sympathetic neurons, which, in turn, attenuates lipolytic energy mobilization by adipocytes.",
    "Current and future pharmacological treatment strategies with regard to aortic disease in Marfan syndrome. INTRODUCTION: Marfan syndrome is a multisystemic connective tissue disorder caused mainly by mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene. The entire cardiovascular system is affected in patients with Marfan syndrome. Aortic root dilatation, aortic valve regurgitation or - the most feared and life-threatening symptom - aortic root dissection are the most common manifestations. Therapeutic strategies, such as prophylactic aortic root surgery and pharmacological therapy, focus on the prevention of aortic dissection. Currently, the standard medicinal treatments targeting aortic dilatation and dissection consist of agents generally used to lower blood pressure and/or the inotropic state of the heart. By these means, the cyclic repetitive forces exerted on the aortic wall are diminished and thus the onset of aortic dilatation is potentially prevented. Although these pharmacological agents may offer some benefit in reduction of aortic aneurysm expansion rate, they do not target the underlying cause of the progressive aortic degradation. AREAS COVERED: This review discusses the effectiveness of frequently prescribed medications used to prevent and delay aortic complications in Marfan syndrome. New insights on the biochemical pathways leading to aortic disease are also discussed to highlight new targets for pharmacological therapy. EXPERT OPINION: Recent insights in the transforming growth factor beta signaling pathway and inflammatory mechanisms in a well-established mouse model of Marfan syndrome, have led to studies exploring new pharmacological treatment strategies with doxycycline, statins and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Pharmacological therapy is focused more on prevention than on delay of aortic wall pathology in Marfan syndrome. Of the new pharmacological treatment strategies targeting aortic pathology in Marfan syndrome, angiotensin receptor type 1 blockers are promising candidates, with several clinical trials currently ongoing.",
    "Cyclin-dependent kinase pathways as targets for women's cancer treatment. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this article, we not only review the preclinical and clinical studies of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors in breast cancer, liposarcoma, mantel cell lymphoma, melanoma and germ cell tumors, but also examine promising preclinical data in glioblastoma, renal and ovarian cancer models that may provide directions for future development. RECENT FINDINGS: Targeting CDKs has been the focus of considerable basic science and clinical research. The CDK 4/6 inhibitors are a novel class of therapeutics that target the CDK 4/6 kinases that promote transition through the cell cycle. Currently, palbociclib (PD0332991, Pfizer), abemaciclib (LY2835219, Lilly) and ribociclib (LEE011, Novartis) are being investigated in clinical trials. These oral agents offer the hope of clinical efficacy in many tumor types, and have been associated with minimal toxicity. Amplification/overexpression of cyclin D, loss of CDKN2A (p16) and amplification/overexpression of CDK4 are proposed biomarkers of improved response to CDK4/6 inhibition. SUMMARY: Palbociclib, abemaciclib and ribociclib have demonstrated very promising clinical activity in breast cancer, liposarcoma, mantel cell lymphoma and melanoma. Moreover, CDK4/6 inhibitors have shown promising preclinical activity in glioblastoma, renal and ovarian cancer models that may provide directions for their future clinical development. Further preclinical and clinical research is needed to better understand mechanisms of resistance and develop rational combination therapies with other targeted agents.",
    "Cysteine shotgun-mass spectrometry (CS-MS) reveals dynamic sequence of protein structure changes within mutant and stressed cells. Questions of if and when protein structures change within cells pervade biology and include questions of how the cytoskeleton sustains stresses on cells--particularly in mutant versus normal cells. Cysteine shotgun labeling with fluorophores is analyzed here with mass spectrometry of the spectrin-actin membrane skeleton in sheared red blood cell ghosts from normal and diseased mice. Sheared samples are compared to static samples at 37 \u00b0C in terms of cell membrane intensity in fluorescence microscopy, separated protein fluorescence, and tryptic peptide modification in liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Spectrin labeling proves to be the most sensitive to shear, whereas binding partners ankyrin and actin exhibit shear thresholds in labeling and both the ankyrin-binding membrane protein band 3 and the spectrin-actin stabilizer 4.1R show minimal differential labeling. Cells from 4.1R-null mice differ significantly from normal in the shear-dependent labeling of spectrin, ankyrin, and band 3: Decreased labeling of spectrin reveals less stress on the mutant network as spectrin dissociates from actin. Mapping the stress-dependent labeling kinetics of \u03b1- and \u03b2-spectrin by LC-MS/MS identifies Cys in these antiparallel chains that are either force-enhanced or force-independent in labeling, with structural analyses indicating the force-enhanced sites are sequestered either in spectrin's triple-helical domains or in interactions with actin or ankyrin. Shear-sensitive sites identified comprehensively here in both spectrin and ankyrin appear consistent with stress relief through forced unfolding followed by cytoskeletal disruption.",
    "DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) mutation affects Snrpn imprinting in the mouse male germ line. DNA methylation and DNA methyltransferases are essential for spermatogenesis. Mutations in the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 gene exert a paternal effect on epigenetic states and phenotypes of offspring, suggesting that DNMT1 is important for the epigenetic remodeling of the genome that takes place during spermatogenesis. However, the specific role of DNMT1 in spermatogenesis and the establishment of genomic imprints in the male germ line remains elusive. To further characterize the effect of DNMT1 deficiency on the resetting of methylation imprints during spermatogenesis, we analyzed the methylation profiles of imprinted regions in the spermatozoa of mice that were heterozygous for a Dnmt1 loss-of-function mutation. The mutation did not affect the H19 or IG differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that are usually highly methylated but led to a partial hypermethylation of the Snrpn DMR, a region that should normally be unmethylated in mature spermatozoa. This defect does not appear in mouse models with mutations in Dnmt3a and Mthfr genes and, therefore, it is specific for the Dnmt1 gene and is suggestive of a role of DNMT1 in imprint resetting or maintenance in the male germ line.",
    "DUX4 and DUX4 downstream target genes are expressed in fetal FSHD muscles. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is one of the most prevalent adult muscular dystrophies. The common clinical signs usually appear during the second decade of life but when the first molecular dysregulations occur is still unknown. Our aim was to determine whether molecular dysregulations can be identified during FSHD fetal muscle development. We compared muscle biopsies derived from FSHD1 fetuses and the cells derived from some of these biopsies with biopsies and cells derived from control fetuses. We mainly focus on DUX4 isoform expression because the expression of DUX4 has been confirmed in both FSHD cells and biopsies by several laboratories. We measured DUX4 isoform expression by using qRT-PCR in fetal FSHD1 myotubes treated or not with an shRNA directed against DUX4 mRNA. We also analyzed DUX4 downstream target gene expression in myotubes and fetal or adult FSHD1 and control quadriceps biopsies. We show that both DUX4-FL isoforms are already expressed in FSHD1 myotubes. Interestingly, DUX4-FL expression level is much lower in trapezius than in quadriceps myotubes, which is confirmed by the level of expression of DUX4 downstream genes. We observed that TRIM43 and MBD3L2 are already overexpressed in FSHD1 fetal quadriceps biopsies, at similar levels to those observed in adult FSHD1 quadriceps biopsies. These results indicate that molecular markers of the disease are already expressed during fetal life, thus opening a new field of investigation for mechanisms leading to FSHD.",
    "Dasatinib, a small-molecule protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, inhibits T-cell activation and proliferation. Dasatinib is an oral small molecule inhibitor of Abl and Src family tyrosine kinases (SFK), including p56(Lck) (Lck). Given the central importance of Lck in transmitting signals from the T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling complex and the potent ability of dasatinib to inhibit Lck activity, we hypothesized this agent could provide a novel route of immunomodulation via targeted inhibition of antigen-induced signaling. Herein, we show that dasatinib inhibits TCR-mediated signal transduction, cellular proliferation, cytokine production, and in vivo T-cell responses. However, dasatinib-mediated inhibition does not induce apoptosis because the effect is reversible or may be overcome by signals bypassing the TCR, such as phorbol ester. Signal transduction and proliferative responses via IL-2 remain essentially unperturbed, suggesting that dasatinib displays specificity for TCR signaling. In addition, dasatinib combined with cyclosporine A or rapamycin led to a much more potent inhibition of T-cell activation, suggesting that targeted inhibition of Lck could be a useful adjunct for enhanced immunomodulation. In combination with currently available immunomodulatory agents, SFK inhibition could potentially increase immunomodulatory efficacy while minimizing toxicity of individual agents.",
    "Dax1 associates with Esrrb and regulates its function in embryonic stem cells. Self-renewal capacity and pluripotency, which are controlled by the Oct3/4-centered transcriptional regulatory network, are major characteristics of embryonic stem (ES) cells. Nuclear hormone receptor Dax1 is one of the crucial factors in the network. Here, we identified an orphan nuclear receptor, Esrrb (estrogen-related receptor beta), as a Dax1-interacting protein. Interaction of Dax1 and Esrrb was mediated through LXXLL motifs of Dax1 and the activation- and ligand-binding domains of Esrrb. Furthermore, Esrrb enhanced the promoter activity of the Dax1 gene via direct binding to Esrrb-binding site 1 (ERRE1, where \"ERRE\" represents \"Esrrb-responsive element\") of the promoter. Expression of Dax1 was suppressed followed by Oct3/4 repression; however, overexpression of Esrrb maintained expression of Dax1 even in the absence of Oct3/4, indicating that Dax1 is a direct downstream target of Esrrb and that Esrrb can regulate Dax1 expression in an Oct3/4-independent manner. We also found that the transcriptional activity of Esrrb was repressed by Dax1. Furthermore, we revealed that Oct3/4, Dax1, and Esrrb have a competitive inhibition capacity for each complex. These data, together with previous findings, suggest that Dax1 functions as a negative regulator of Esrrb and Oct3/4, and these molecules form a regulatory loop for controlling the pluripotency and self-renewal capacity of ES cells.",
    "Deep brain stimulation in critical care conditions. Some neurological conditions require admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) where deep sedation and mechanical ventilation are administered to improve the patient's condition. Nevertheless, these treatments are not always helpful in disease control. At this stage, deep brain stimulation (DBS) could become a viable alternative in the treatment of critical neurological conditions with long-lasting clinical benefit. The value of deep brain stimulation has been investigated in the treatment of patients who had undergone surgical electrode implants as an emergency procedure to treat acute life-threatening conditions requiring admission to neurological ICU (NICU). A before-and-after perspective study was examined of seven patients who were treated with DBS for status dystonicus (SD) and post-stroke severe hemiballismus. Bilateral globus pallidus internus (GPi) DBS was performed in five SD patients and unilateral ventralis oralis anterior and posterior (Voa/Vop) nucleus of the thalamus DBS in two post-stroke hemiballismus patients. Bilateral GPi-DBS allowed SD resolution in a time lapse varying from 1\u00a0week to 3\u00a0months. No clear improvements compared to the baseline clinical condition were observed. Unilateral Voa/Vop-DBS intervention controlled hemiballismus after 10\u00a0h, and the patient was discharged in 2\u00a0days. The other patient was transferred from the NICU to the neurosurgery ward after 13\u00a0days. No surgical complications were observed in any of the above procedures. Neurostimulation procedures could represent a valuable choice in critical care conditions, when involuntary movements are continuous, life-threatening and refractory to intensive care procedures. DBS is feasible, safe and effective in selected cases.",
    "DeepBlueR: large-scale epigenomic analysis in R.

    "DeepCAGE transcriptomics identify HOXD10 as a transcription factor regulating lymphatic endothelial responses to VEGF-C. Lymphangiogenesis plays a crucial role during development, in cancer metastasis and in inflammation. Activation of VEGFR-3 (also known as FLT4) by VEGF-C is one of the main drivers of lymphangiogenesis, but the transcriptional events downstream of VEGFR-3 activation are largely unknown. Recently, we identified a wave of immediate early transcription factors that are upregulated in human lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) within the first 30 to 80 min after VEGFR-3 activation. Expression of these transcription factors must be regulated by additional pre-existing transcription factors that are rapidly activated by VEGFR-3 signaling. Using transcription factor activity analysis, we identified the homeobox transcription factor HOXD10 to be specifically activated at early time points after VEGFR-3 stimulation, and to regulate expression of immediate early transcription factors, including NR4A1. Gain- and loss-of-function studies revealed that HOXD10 is involved in LECs migration and formation of cord-like structures. Furthermore, HOXD10 regulates expression of VE-cadherin, claudin-5 and NOS3 (also known as e-NOS), and promotes lymphatic endothelial permeability. Taken together, these results reveal an important and unanticipated role of HOXD10 in the regulation of VEGFR-3 signaling in lymphatic endothelial cells, and in the control of lymphangiogenesis and permeability.",
    "DeepLoc: prediction of protein subcellular localization using deep learning. Motivation: The prediction of eukaryotic protein subcellular localization is a well-studied topic in bioinformatics due to its relevance in proteomics research. Many machine learning methods have been successfully applied in this task, but in most of them, predictions rely on annotation of homologues from knowledge databases. For novel proteins where no annotated homologues exist, and for predicting the effects of sequence variants, it is desirable to have methods for predicting protein properties from sequence information only. Results: Here, we present a prediction algorithm using deep neural networks to predict protein subcellular localization relying only on sequence information. At its core, the prediction model uses a recurrent neural network that processes the entire protein sequence and an attention mechanism identifying protein regions important for the subcellular localization. The model was trained and tested on a protein dataset extracted from one of the latest UniProt releases, in which experimentally annotated proteins follow more stringent criteria than previously. We demonstrate that our model achieves a good accuracy (78% for 10 categories; 92% for membrane-bound or soluble), outperforming current state-of-the-art algorithms, including those relying on homology information. Availability and implementation: The method is available as a web server at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/DeepLoc. Example code is available at https://github.com/JJAlmagro/subcellular_localization.

    "Defining the phenotype of restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease (RLS/WED): a clinical and polysomnographic study. Clinical features variability between familial and sporadic restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease (RLS/WED) has been previously reported. With this retrospective cohort study, we aimed to determine the clinical and polysomnographic characteristics of 400 RLS/WED patients. Patients with familial RLS/WED were significantly younger than sporadic RLS/WED, while clinical and polysomnographic characteristics were similar in both groups. No difference was found for the age-at-onset between idiopathic and secondary RLS/WED. Periodic limb movements (PLM) index and REM sleep time were higher in idiopathic RLS/WED. Time of onset of symptoms was in the evening or at bedtime in 28.04 and 37.80% of patients, respectively, while in 21.34% of patients onset was more than 1 h after sleep onset. Impulse control and compulsive behaviours (ICBs) were found in 13.29% patients on dopamine agonist therapy. Our analyses support the hypothesis that patients with a familial history of RLS/WED may have a genetic component. Nevertheless, the dichotomy between early and late onset disease seems to be less sharp than previously reported. A large proportion of RLS/WED patients can have atypical features, therefore making the diagnosis challenging. Some cases can be missed even when the patient refers to a sleep specialist, as revealed by the partial absence of daytime symptoms, the high comorbidity with insomnia and other sleep complaints and the high percentage of symptoms beginning after sleep onset. This draws attention on the importance of a careful evaluation of the patient, to recognize potentially treatable secondary forms of RLS/WED.",
    "Defining the sequence requirements for the positioning of base J in DNA using SMRT sequencing. Base J (\u03b2-D-glucosyl-hydroxymethyluracil) replaces 1% of T in the Leishmania genome and is only found in telomeric repeats (99%) and in regions where transcription starts and stops. This highly restricted distribution must be co-determined by the thymidine hydroxylases (JBP1 and JBP2) that catalyze the initial step in J synthesis. To determine the DNA sequences recognized by JBP1/2, we used SMRT sequencing of DNA segments inserted into plasmids grown in Leishmania tarentolae. We show that SMRT sequencing recognizes base J in DNA. Leishmania DNA segments that normally contain J also picked up J when present in the plasmid, whereas control sequences did not. Even a segment of only 10 telomeric (GGGTTA) repeats was modified in the plasmid. We show that J modification usually occurs at pairs of Ts on opposite DNA strands, separated by 12 nucleotides. Modifications occur near G-rich sequences capable of forming G-quadruplexes and JBP2 is needed, as it does not occur in JBP2-null cells. We propose a model whereby de novo J insertion is mediated by JBP2. JBP1 then binds to J and hydroxylates another T 13 bp downstream (but not upstream) on the complementary strand, allowing JBP1 to maintain existing J following DNA replication.",
    "Definition of a type of abnormal vaginal flora that is distinct from bacterial vaginosis: aerobic vaginitis. OBJECTIVE: To define an entity of abnormal vaginal flora: aerobic vaginitis. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium. SAMPLE: 631 women attending for routine prenatal care or attending vaginitis clinic. METHODS: Samples were taken for fresh wet mount microscopy of vaginal fluid, vaginal cultures and measurement of lactate, succinate and cytokine levels in vaginal fluid. Smears deficient in lactobacilli and positive for clue cells were considered to indicate a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. Aerobic vaginitis was diagnosed if smears were deficient in lactobacilli, positive for cocci or coarse bacilli, positive for parabasal epithelial cells, and/or positive for vaginal leucocytes (plus their granular aspect). RESULTS: Genital complaints include red inflammation, yellow discharge, vaginal dyspareunia. Group B streptococci, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and trichomonas vaginalis are frequently cultured. Vaginal lactate concentration is severely depressed in women with aerobic vaginitis, as in bacterial vaginosis, but vaginal succinate is not produced. Also in contrast to bacterial vaginosis, aerobic vaginitis produces a host immune response that leads to high production of interleukin-6, interleukin-1-beta and leukaemia inhibitory factor in the vaginal fluid. CONCLUSION: Aerobic vaginitis is associated with aerobic micro-organisms, mainly group B streptococci and E. coli. Its characteristics are different from those of bacterial vaginosis and elicit an important host response. The most severe form of aerobic vaginitis equals desquamative inflammatory vaginitis. In theory, aerobic vaginitis may be a better candidate than bacterial vaginosis as the cause of pregnancy complications, such as ascending chorioamnionitis, preterm rupture of the membranes and preterm delivery.",
    "Delamanid: a review of its use in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Delamanid (Deltyba(\u00ae)), a nitroimidazo-oxazole derivative, is a new anti-tuberculosis (TB) drug which exhibits potent in vitro and in vivo antitubercular activity against drug-susceptible and -resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is approved in several countries, including Japan and those of the EU, for use as part of an appropriate combination regimen in adults with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be composed due to resistance or tolerability. In a robust phase\u00a0II trial in adult patients with MDR-TB, oral delamanid 100\u00a0mg twice daily for 2\u00a0months plus an optimized background regimen improved sputum culture conversion rates to a significantly greater extent than placebo. In a 6-month extension study, long-term ( < 8\u00a0months) treatment with delamanid was associated with a higher incidence of favourable outcomes (i.e. cured or completed all treatment) than short-term ( < 2\u00a0months) treatment, with an accompanying reduction inunfavourable outcomes as defined by the WHO (i.e. pre-specified proportion of TB-positive sputum cultures, death or treatment discontinuation for > 2\u00a0months without medical approval). Delamanid was not associated with clinically relevant drug-drug interactions, including with antiretroviral drugs and those commonly used in treating TB. Delamanid was generally well tolerated in patients with MDR-TB, with gastrointestinal adverse events and insomnia reported most commonly. Although the incidence of QT interval prolongation was higher with delamanid-based therapy, it was not associated with clinical symptoms such as syncope and arrhythmia. In conclusion, delamanid is a useful addition to the treatment options currently available for patients with MDR-TB.",
    "Delayed myelination is not a constant feature of Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome: report of a new case and review of the literature. INTRODUCTION: Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome is an X-linked condition caused by mutations of the monocarboxylate transporter 8 gene. This syndrome is characterized by axial hypotonia, severe mental retardation, dysarthria, athetoid movements, spastic paraplegia, and a typical thyroid hormone profile. In most of the cases reported so far, brain magnetic resonance imaging showed delayed myelination of the central white matter and this finding greatly affects the diagnosis of the syndrome. CASE REPORT: We present a new case studied with magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy and we reviewed all the articles published between 2004 and 2012 containing information on brain neuroimaging in this syndrome. An Italian boy, showing a classical phenotype of the syndrome, was diagnosed at 17months of age. Genetic analysis revealed a new frameshift mutation of the monocarboxylate transporter 8 gene. His brain magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy, performed at the age of 14months, were normal. DISCUSSION: Among the 33 cases reported in the literature, 3 cases had normal neuroimaging and in 7 of 14 cases, having a longitudinal follow-up, the initial finding of delayed myelination gradually improved. Our case and the review of the pertinent literature suggest that Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome should be suspected in males with the typical neurological and thyroid profile, even in cases with normal brain myelination.",
    "Detailed mechanistic analysis of gevokizumab, an allosteric anti-IL-1\u03b2 antibody with differential receptor-modulating properties. Interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) is a proinflammatory cytokine that is implicated in many autoinflammatory disorders, but is also important in defense against pathogens. Thus, there is a need to safely and effectively modulate IL-1\u03b2 activity to reduce pathology while maintaining function. Gevokizumab is a potent anti-IL-1\u03b2 antibody being developed as a treatment for diseases in which IL-1\u03b2 has been associated with pathogenesis. Previous data indicated that gevokizumab negatively modulates IL-1\u03b2 signaling through an allosteric mechanism. Because IL-1\u03b2 signaling is a complex, dynamic process involving multiple components, it is important to understand the kinetics of IL-1\u03b2 signaling and the impact of gevokizumab on this process. In the present study, we measured the impact of gevokizumab on the IL-1\u03b2 system using Schild analysis and surface plasmon resonance studies, both of which demonstrated that gevokizumab decreases the binding affinity of IL-1\u03b2 for the IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI) signaling receptor, but not the IL-1 counter-regulatory decoy receptor (IL-1 receptor type II). Gevokizumab inhibits both the binding of IL-1\u03b2 to IL-1RI and the subsequent recruitment of IL-1 accessory protein primarily by reducing the association rates of these interactions. Based on this information and recently published structural data, we propose that gevokizumab decreases the association rate for binding of IL-1\u03b2 to its receptor by altering the electrostatic surface potential of IL-1\u03b2, thus reducing the contribution of electrostatic steering to the rapid association rate. These data indicate, therefore, that gevokizumab is a unique inhibitor of IL-1\u03b2 signaling that may offer an alternative to current therapies for IL-1\u03b2-associated autoinflammatory diseases.",
    "Detection of long repeat expansions from PCR-free whole-genome sequence data. Identifying large expansions of short tandem repeats (STRs), such as those that cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and fragile X syndrome, is challenging for short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. A solution to this problem is an important step toward integrating WGS into precision medicine. We developed a software tool called ExpansionHunter that, using PCR-free WGS short-read data, can genotype repeats at the locus of interest, even if the expanded repeat is larger than the read length. We applied our algorithm to WGS data from 3001 ALS patients who have been tested for the presence of the C9orf72 repeat expansion with repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR). Compared against this truth data, ExpansionHunter correctly classified all (212/212, 95% CI [0.98, 1.00]) of the expanded samples as either expansions (208) or potential expansions (4). Additionally, 99.9% (2786/2789, 95% CI [0.997, 1.00]) of the wild-type samples were correctly classified as wild type by this method with the remaining three samples identified as possible expansions. We further applied our algorithm to a set of 152 samples in which every sample had one of eight different pathogenic repeat expansions, including those associated with fragile X syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia, and Huntington's disease, and correctly flagged all but one of the known repeat expansions. Thus, ExpansionHunter can be used to accurately detect known pathogenic repeat expansions and provides researchers with a tool that can be used to identify new pathogenic repeat expansions.",
    "Determinants of Dropout and Nonadherence in a Dementia Prevention Randomized Controlled Trial: The Prevention of Dementia by Intensive Vascular Care Trial. OBJECTIVES: To explore and compare sociodemographic, clinical, and neuropsychiatric determinants of dropout and nonadherence in older people participating in an open-label cluster-randomized controlled trial-the Prevention of Dementia by Intensive Vascular care (preDIVA) trial-over 6 years. DESIGN: Secondary analysis. SETTING: One hundred sixteen general practices in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling individuals aged 70 to 78 (N = 2,994). INTERVENTION: Nurse-led multidomain intervention targeting cardiovascular risk factors to prevent dementia. MEASUREMENTS: The associations between participant baseline sociodemographic (age, sex, education), clinical (medical history, disability, cardiovascular risk), neuropsychiatric (depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale-15), and cognitive (Mini-Mental State Examination)) characteristics and dropout from the trial and nonadherence to the trial intervention were explored using multilevel logistic regression models. RESULTS: Older age, poorer cognitive function, more symptoms of depression, and greater disability were the most important determinants of dropout of older people. The presence of cardiovascular risk factors was not associated with dropout but was associated with nonadherence. Being overweight was a risk factor for nonadherence, whereas people with high blood pressure or a low level of physical exercise adhered better to the intervention. The association between poorer cognitive function and symptoms of depression and dropout was stronger in the control group than in the intervention group, and vice versa for increased disability. CONCLUSION: In a large dementia prevention trial with 6-year follow-up, dropout was associated with older age, poorer cognitive function, symptoms of depression, and disability at baseline. These findings can help to guide the design of future dementia prevention trials in older adults. The associations found between cardiovascular risk factors and nonadherence need to be confirmed in other older populations receiving cardiovascular prevention interventions.",
    "Determination of the critical concentration required for desmin assembly. The critical concentration required for filament assembly in vitro from highly purified desmin was determined by both turbidity and centrifugation assays. Assembly was done in the presence of 2 mM-Ca2+, 2 mM-Mg2+ or 150 mM-Na+ at 2, 22 and 37 degrees C. Similar values for critical concentration were obtained by both assays. As temperature increased, critical concentration decreased for each cation. The critical concentration was lowest in the presence of Ca2+ at 2, 22 and 37 degrees C, but was highest in the presence of 150 mM-Na+ at 2 degrees C. Negative staining showed that supernatants from the centrifugation assays contained protofilaments, protofibrils and short particles (less than 300 nm), but pellets contained long filaments (greater than 1 micron) with an average diameter of 10 nm. As the temperature increased, both the average diameter and average length of particles in the supernatant increased. Thermodynamic analysis indicated that hydrophobic interactions were dominant during desmin assembly, but that ionic interactions might also be involved. Our results demonstrated that the specific cation and temperature and temperature-cation interactions all are important in assembly of desmin intermediate filaments.",
    "Development of a real-time fluorescence loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for rapid and quantitative detection of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense tropical race 4 in soil. Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc), the causal agent of Fusarium wilt (Panama disease), is one of the most devastating diseases of banana (Musa spp.). The Foc tropical race 4 (TR4) is currently known as a major concern in global banana production. No effective resistance is known in Musa to Foc, and no effective measures for controlling Foc once banana plants have been infected in place. Early and accurate detection of Foc TR4 is essential to protect banana industry and guide banana planting. A real-time fluorescence loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (RealAmp) was developed for the rapid and quantitative detection of Foc TR4 in soil. The detection limit of the RealAmp assay was approximately 0.4 pg/\u00b5l plasmid DNA when mixed with extracted soil DNA or 10(3) spores/g of artificial infested soil, and no cross-reaction with other relative pathogens were observed. The RealAmp assay for quantifying genomic DNA of TR4 was confirmed by testing both artificially and naturally infested samples. Quantification of the soil-borne pathogen DNA of Foc TR4 in naturally infested samples was no significant difference compared to classic real-time PCR (P>0.05). Additionally, RealAmp assay was visual with an improved closed-tube visual detection system by adding SYBR Green I fluorescent dye to the inside of the lid prior to amplification, which avoided the inhibitory effects of the stain on DNA amplification and makes the assay more convenient in the field and could thus become a simple, rapid and effective technique that has potential as an alternative tool for the detection and monitoring of Foc TR4 in field, which would be a routine DNA-based testing service for the soil-borne pathogen in South China.",
    "Development of endometrial carcinoma in a patient with leprechaunism (donohue syndrome). Leprechaunism is a rare autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by severe insulin resistance. This disease is caused by a defective insulin receptor and features abnormal glucose metabolism and retarded intrauterine and postnatal growth. However, there are few reports on the long-term course of leprechaunism. We reported the long-term clinical course and rh-IGF-1 treatment in a patient with leprechaunism. During follow-up her diabetes gradually deteriorated despite of treatment of rh-IGF-1. Furthermore, she developed endometrioid adenocarcinoma at the age of 24 yr. The development of endometrial disease must be carefully followed up in this disease.",
    "Diagnosing synaesthesia with online colour pickers: maximising sensitivity and specificity. The most commonly used method for formally assessing grapheme-colour synaesthesia (i.e., experiencing colours in response to letter and/or number stimuli) involves selecting colours from a large colour palette on several occasions and measuring consistency of the colours selected. However, the ability to diagnose synaesthesia using this method depends on several factors that have not been directly contrasted. These include the type of colour space used (e.g., RGB, HSV, CIELUV, CIELAB) and different measures of consistency (e.g., city block and Euclidean distance in colour space). This study aims to find the most reliable way of diagnosing grapheme-colour synaesthesia based on maximising sensitivity (i.e., ability of a test to identify true synaesthetes) and specificity (i.e., ability of a test to identify true non-synaesthetes). We show, applying ROC (receiver operating characteristics) to binary classification of a large sample of self-declared synaesthetes and non-synaesthetes, that the consistency criterion (i.e., cut-off value) for diagnosing synaesthesia is considerably higher than the current standard in the field. We also show that methods based on perceptual CIELUV and CIELAB colour models (rather than RGB and HSV colour representations) and Euclidean distances offer an even greater sensitivity and specificity than most currently used measures. Together, these findings offer improved heuristics for the behavioural assessment of grapheme-colour synaesthesia.",
    "Diagnostic accuracy of the Berlin questionnaire, STOP-BANG, STOP, and Epworth sleepiness scale in detecting obstructive sleep apnea: A bivariate meta-analysis. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent sleep disorder; however, it remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. Although screening tools such as the Berlin questionnaire (BQ), STOP-BANG questionnaire (SBQ), STOP questionnaire (STOP), and Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) are widely used for OSA, the findings regarding their diagnostic accuracy are controversial. Therefore, this meta-analysis investigated and compared the summary sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) among the BQ, SBQ, STOP, and ESS according to the severity of OSA. Electronic databases, namely the Embase, PubMed, PsycINFO, ProQuest dissertations and theses A&I databases, and China knowledge resource integrated database, were searched from their inception to July 15, 2016. We included studies examining the sensitivity and specificity of the BQ, SBQ, STOP, and ESS against the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) or respiratory disturbance index (RDI). The revised quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies was used to evaluate the methodological quality of studies. A random-effects bivariate model was used to estimate the summary sensitivity, specificity, and DOR of the tools. We identified 108 studies including a total of 47 989 participants. The summary estimates were calculated for the BQ, SBQ, STOP, and ESS in detecting mild (AHI/RDI\u00a0 > \u00a05 events/h), moderate (AHI/RDI\u00a0 > \u00a015 events/h), and severe OSA (AHI/RDI\u00a0 > \u00a030 events/h). The performance levels of the BQ, SBQ, STOP, and ESS in detecting OSA of various severity levels are outlined as follows: for mild OSA, the pooled sensitivity levels were 76%, 88%, 87%, and 54%; pooled specificity levels were 59%, 42%, 42%, and 65%; and pooled DORs were 4.30, 5.13, 4.85, and 2.18, respectively. For moderate OSA, the pooled sensitivity levels were 77%, 90%, 89%, and 47%; pooled specificity levels were 44%, 36%, 32%, and 621%; and pooled DORs were 2.68, 5.05, 3.71, and 1.45, respectively. For severe OSA, the pooled sensitivity levels were 84%, 93%, 90%, and 58%; pooled specificity levels were 38%, 35%, 28%, and 60%; and pooled DORs were 3.10, 6.51, 3.37, and 2.10, respectively. Therefore, for mild, moderate, and severe OSA, the pooled sensitivity and DOR of the SBQ were significantly higher than those of other screening tools (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05); however, the specificity of the SBQ was lower than that of the ESS (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Moreover, age, sex, body mass index, study sample size, study populations, presence of comorbidities, PSG or portable monitoring performance, and risk of bias in the domains of the index test and reference standard were significant moderators of sensitivity and specificity (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Compared with the BQ, STOP, and ESS, the SBQ is a more accurate tool for detecting mild, moderate, and severe OSA. Sleep specialists should use the SBQ to conduct patient interviews for the early diagnosis of OSA in clinical settings, particularly in resource-poor countries and sleep clinics where PSG is unavailable.",
    "Diagnostic and therapeutic update on diabetic foot osteomyelitis. Diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) is the most common infection associated to diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). This review is designed to provide an update on the diagnosis and treatment of DFO based on an analysis of MEDLINE through PubMed using as search criterion \"Diabetic Foot Osteomyelitis\". Authors have included in this review the most relevant manuscripts regarding diagnosis and treatment of DFO. After review and critical analysis of publications, it may be concluded that diagnosis of DFO is not simple because of its heterogeneous presentation. Clinical inflammatory signs, probe-to-bone test, and plain X-rays are postulated as the basic tests for clinical diagnosis when DFO is suspected. Diagnosis should be supported by laboratory tests, of which ESR (>70mm/h) has been shown to be most precise. MRI is the most accurate imaging test, especially for differential diagnosis with Charcot foot. Pathogen isolation by bone culture is essential when the patient is treated with ATB only. Medical or surgical treatment should be based on the clinical characteristics of the patient and the lesion. Surgery should always be an option if medical treatment fails.",
    "Differential involvement of COX1 and COX2 in the vasculopathy associated with the alpha-galactosidase A-knockout mouse. The lysosomal storage disorder Fabry disease is characterized by excessive globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) accumulation in major organs such as the heart and kidney. Defective lysosomal alpha-galactosidase A (Gla) is responsible for excessive Gb3 accumulation, and one cell sensitive to the effects of Gb3 accumulation is vascular endothelium. Endothelial dysfunction is associated with Fabry disease and excessive cellular Gb3. We previously demonstrated that excessive vascular Gb3 in a mouse model of Fabry disease, the Gla-knockout (Gla(-/0)) mouse, results in abnormal vascular function, which includes abnormal endothelium-dependent contractions, a vascular phenomenon known to involve cyclooxygenase (COX). Therefore, we hypothesized that the vasculopathy in the Gla knockout mouse may be due to a vasoactive COX-derived product. To test this hypothesis, vascular reactivity experiments were performed in aortic rings from wild-type (Gla(+/0)) and Gla(-/0) mice in the presence and absence of specific and nonspecific COX inhibitors. Specific inhibition of COX1 or COX2 in endothelium-intact rings from Gla(-/0) mice decreased overall phenylephrine contractility compared with untreated Gla(-/0) rings, whereas COX inhibitors had no effect on contractility in endothelium-denuded rings. Nonspecific inhibition of COX with indomethacin (10 micromol/l) or COX1 inhibition with valeryl salicylate (3 mmol/l) improved endothelial function in rings from Gla(-/0) mice, but COX2 inhibition with NS-398 (1 micromol/l) further increased endothelial dysfunction in rings from Gla(-/0) mice. These results suggest that, in the Gla(-/0) mice, COX1 and COX2 activity are increased and localized in the endothelium, producing vasopressor and vasorelaxant products, which contribute to the Fabry-related vasculopathy.",
    "Differential risk of tuberculosis reactivation among anti-TNF therapies is due to drug binding kinetics and permeability. Increased rates of tuberculosis (TB) reactivation have been reported in humans treated with TNF-\u03b1 (TNF)-neutralizing drugs, and higher rates are observed with anti-TNF Abs (e.g., infliximab) as compared with TNF receptor fusion protein (etanercept). Mechanisms driving differential reactivation rates and differences in drug action are not known. We use a computational model of a TB granuloma formation that includes TNF/TNF receptor dynamics to elucidate these mechanisms. Our analyses yield three important insights. First, drug binding to membrane-bound TNF critically impairs granuloma function. Second, a higher risk of reactivation induced from Ab-type treatments is primarily due to differences in TNF/drug binding kinetics and permeability. Apoptotic and cytolytic activities of Abs and pharmacokinetic fluctuations in blood concentration of drug are not essential to inducing TB reactivation. Third, we predict specific host factors that, if augmented, would improve granuloma function during anti-TNF therapy. Our findings have implications for the development of safer anti-TNF drugs to treat inflammatory diseases.",
    "Difficulties in diagnosing Marfan syndrome using current FBN1 databases. PURPOSE: The diagnostic criteria of Marfan syndrome (MFS) highlight the importance of a FBN1 mutation test in diagnosing MFS. As genetic sequencing becomes better, cheaper, and more accessible, the expected increase in the number of genetic tests will become evident, resulting in numerous genetic variants that need to be evaluated for disease-causing effects based on database information. The aim of this study was to evaluate genetic variants in four databases and review the relevant literature. METHODS: We assessed background data on 23 common variants registered in ESP6500 and classified as causing MFS in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD). We evaluated data in four variant databases (HGMD, UMD-FBN1, ClinVar, and UniProt) according to the diagnostic criteria for MFS and compared the results with the classification of each variant in the four databases. RESULTS: None of the 23 variants was clearly associated with MFS, even though all classifications in the databases stated otherwise. CONCLUSION: A genetic diagnosis of MFS cannot reliably be based on current variant databases because they contain incorrectly interpreted conclusions on variants. Variants must be evaluated by time-consuming review of the background material in the databases and by combining these data with expert knowledge on MFS. This is a major problem because we expect even more genetic test results in the near future as a result of the reduced cost and process time for next-generation sequencing.Genet Med 18 1, 98-102.",
    "Digenic inheritance of an SMCHD1 mutation and an FSHD-permissive D4Z4 allele causes facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2. Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is characterized by chromatin relaxation of the D4Z4 macrosatellite array on chromosome 4 and expression of the D4Z4-encoded DUX4 gene in skeletal muscle. The more common form, autosomal dominant FSHD1, is caused by contraction of the D4Z4 array, whereas the genetic determinants and inheritance of D4Z4 array contraction-independent FSHD2 are unclear. Here, we show that mutations in SMCHD1 (encoding structural maintenance of chromosomes flexible hinge domain containing 1) on chromosome 18 reduce SMCHD1 protein levels and segregate with genome-wide D4Z4 CpG hypomethylation in human kindreds. FSHD2 occurs in individuals who inherited both the SMCHD1 mutation and a normal-sized D4Z4 array on a chromosome 4 haplotype permissive for DUX4 expression. Reducing SMCHD1 levels in skeletal muscle results in D4Z4 contraction-independent DUX4 expression. Our study identifies SMCHD1 as an epigenetic modifier of the D4Z4 metastable epiallele and as a causal genetic determinant of FSHD2 and possibly other human diseases subject to epigenetic regulation.",
    "Discovery of an antibody for pan-ebolavirus therapy. During the latest outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa, monoclonal antibody therapy (e.g., ZMapp) was utilized to treat patients. However, due to the antigenic differences among the five ebolavirus species, the current therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are only effective against viruses of the species Zaire ebolavirus. Although this particular species has indeed caused the majority of human infections in Central and, recently, West Africa, other ebolavirus species (e.g., Sudan ebolavirus and Bundibugyo ebolavirus) have also repeatedly caused outbreaks in Central Africa and thus should not be neglected in the development of countermeasures against ebolaviruses. Here we report the generation of an ebolavirus glycoprotein-specific monoclonal antibody that effectively inhibits cellular entry of representative isolates of all known ebolavirus species in vitro and show its protective efficacy in mouse models of ebolavirus infections. This novel neutralizing monoclonal antibody targets a highly conserved internal fusion loop in the glycoprotein molecule and prevents membrane fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes. The discovery of this highly cross-neutralizing antibody provides a promising option for broad-acting ebolavirus antibody therapy and will accelerate the design of improved vaccines that can selectively elicit cross-neutralizing antibodies against multiple species of ebolaviruses.",
    "Disruption of ALX1 causes extreme microphthalmia and severe facial clefting: expanding the spectrum of autosomal-recessive ALX-related frontonasal dysplasia. We present an autosomal-recessive frontonasal dysplasia (FND) characterized by bilateral extreme microphthalmia, bilateral oblique facial cleft, complete cleft palate, hypertelorism, wide nasal bridge with hypoplasia of the ala nasi, and low-set, posteriorly rotated ears in two distinct families. Using Affymetrix 250K SNP array genotyping and homozygosity mapping, we mapped this clinical entity to chromosome 12q21. In one of the families, three siblings were affected, and CNV analysis of the critical region showed a homozygous 3.7 Mb deletion containing the ALX1 (CART1) gene, which encodes the aristaless-like homeobox 1 transcription factor. In the second family we identified a homozygous donor-splice-site mutation (c.531+1G > A) in the ALX1 gene, providing evidence that complete loss of function of ALX1 protein causes severe disruption of early craniofacial development. Unlike loss of its murine ortholog, loss of human ALX1 does not result in neural-tube defects; however, it does severely affect the orchestrated fusion between frontonasal, nasomedial, nasolateral, and maxillary processes during early-stage embryogenesis. This study further expands the spectrum of the recently recognized autosomal-recessive ALX-related FND phenotype in humans.",
    "Disruption of SMIM1 causes the Vel- blood type. Here, we report the biochemical and genetic basis of the Vel blood group antigen, which has been a vexing mystery for decades, especially as anti-Vel regularly causes severe haemolytic transfusion reactions. The protein carrying the Vel blood group antigen was biochemically purified from red blood cell membranes. Mass spectrometry-based de novo peptide sequencing identified this protein to be small integral membrane protein 1 (SMIM1), a previously uncharacterized single-pass membrane protein. Expression of SMIM1 cDNA in Vel- cultured cells generated anti-Vel cell surface reactivity, confirming that SMIM1 encoded the Vel blood group antigen. A cohort of 70 Vel- individuals was found to be uniformly homozygous for a 17 nucleotide deletion in the coding sequence of SMIM1. The genetic homogeneity of the Vel- blood type, likely having a common origin, facilitated the development of two highly specific DNA-based tests for rapid Vel genotyping, which can be easily integrated into blood group genotyping platforms. These results answer a 60-year-old riddle and provide tools of immediate assistance to all clinicians involved in the care of Vel- patients.",
    "Does the linear Sry transcript function as a ceRNA for miR-138? The sense of antisense. Recently, the sex determining region Y ( Sry) and the cerebellar degeneration-related protein 1 ( CDR1as) RNA transcripts have been described to function as a new class of post-transcriptional regulatory RNAs that behave as circular endogenous RNA sponges for the micro RNAs (miRNAs) miR-138 and miR-7, respectively. A special feature of the Sry gene is its ability to generate linear and circular transcripts, both transcribed in the sense orientation. Here we remark that both sense (e.g. Sry RNA) and antisense (e.g. CDR1as) transcripts could circularize and behave as miRNAs sponges, and importantly, that also protein-coding segments of mRNAs could also assume this role. Thus, it is reasonable to think that the linear Sry sense transcript could additionally act as a miRNA sponge, or as an endogenous competing RNA for miR-138.",
    "Dopamine transporter (DAT1) VNTR polymorphism in 12 Indian populations. The dopamine transporter (DAT1) is a membrane spanning protein that binds the neurotransmitter dopamine and performs re-uptake of dopamine from the synapse into a neuron. The gene encoding DAT1 consists of 15 exons spanning 60 kb on chromosome 5p15.32. Several studies have investigated the possible associations between variants in DAT1 gene and psychiatric disorders. The present study aimed to determine the distribution of the variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region of DAT1 in 12 Indian populations. A total of 471 healthy unrelated individuals in 12 Indian populations from 3 linguistic groups were included in the present study. The analysis was carried out using PCR and electrophoresis. Overall, 4 alleles of the DAT1 40-bp VNTR, ranging from 7 to 11 repeats were detected. Heterozygosity indices were low and varied from 0.114 to 0.406. The results demonstrate the variability of the DAT1 40-bp VNTR polymorphism in Indian populations and revealed a high similarity with East Asian populations.",
    "Drug candidates in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major form of senile dementia, characterized by progressive memory and neuronal loss combined with cognitive impairment. AD is the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, affecting one-fifth of those aged over 85\u00a0years. Recent therapeutic approaches have been strongly influenced by five neuropathological hallmarks of AD: acetylcholine deficiency, glutamate excitotoxicity, extracellular deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2 plague), formation of intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NTFs), and neuroinflammation. The lowered concentrations of acetylcholine (ACh) in AD result in a progressive and significant loss of cognitive and behavioral function. Current AD medications, memantine and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) alleviate some of these symptoms by enhancing cholinergic signaling, but they are not curative. Since 2003, no new drugs have been approved for the treatment of AD. This article focuses on the current research in clinical trials targeting the neuropathological findings of AD including acetylcholine response, glutamate transmission, A\u03b2 clearance, tau protein deposits, and neuroinflammation. These investigations include acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, agonists and antagonists of neurotransmitter receptors, \u03b2-secretase (BACE) or \u03b3-secretase inhibitors, vaccines or antibodies targeting A\u03b2 clearance or tau protein, as well as anti-inflammation compounds. Ongoing Phase III clinical trials via passive immunotherapy against A\u03b2 peptides (crenezumab, gantenerumab, and aducanumab) seem to be promising. Using small molecules blocking 5-HT serotonin receptor (intepirdine), inhibiting BACE activity (E2609, AZD3293, and verubecestat), or reducing tau aggregation (TRx0237) are also currently in Phase III clinical trials. We here systemically review the findings from recent clinical trials to provide a comprehensive review of novel therapeutic compounds in the treatment and prevention of AD.",
    "Drug transporter gene expression in human colorectal tissue and cell lines: modulation with antiretrovirals for microbicide optimization. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to comprehensively assess mRNA expression of 84 drug transporters in human colorectal biopsies and six representative cell lines, and to investigate the alteration of drug transporter gene expression after exposure to three candidate microbicidal antiretroviral (ARV) drugs (tenofovir, darunavir and dapivirine) in the colorectal epithelium. The outcome of the objectives informs development of optimal ARV-based microbicidal formulations for prevention of HIV-1 infection. METHODS: Drug transporter mRNA expression was quantified from colorectal biopsies and cell lines by quantitative real-time PCR. Relative mRNA expression was quantified in Caco-2 cells and colorectal explants after induction with ARVs. Data were analysed using Pearson's product moment correlation (r), hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA). RESULTS: Expression of 58 of the 84 transporters was documented in colorectal biopsies, with genes for CNT2, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and MRP3 showing the highest expression. No difference was noted between individual subjects when analysed by age, gender or anatomical site (rectum or recto-sigmoid) (r = 0.95-0.99). High expression of P-gp and CNT2 proteins was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining. Similarity between colorectal tissue and cell-line drug transporter gene expression was variable (r = 0.64-0.84). PCA showed distinct clustering of human colorectal biopsy samples, with the Caco-2 cells defined as the best surrogate system. Induction of Caco-2 cell lines with ARV drugs suggests that darunavir-based microbicides incorporating tenofovir may result in drug-drug interactions likely to affect distribution of individual drugs to sub-epithelial target cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings will help optimize complex formulations of rectal microbicides to realize their full potential as an effective approach for pre-exposure prophylaxis against HIV-1 infection.",
    "Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome: case report of fetal unilateral ventriculomegaly and hypoplastic left middle cerebral artery. Prenatal ultrasonographic detection of unilateral cerebral ventriculomegaly arises suspicion of pathological condition related to cerebrospinal fluid flow obstruction or cerebral parenchimal pathology. Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome is a rare condition characterized by cerebral hemiatrophy, calvarial thickening, skull and facial asymmetry, contralateral hemiparesis, cognitive impairment and seizures. Congenital and acquired types are recognized and have been described, mainly in late childhood, adolescence and adult ages. We describe a female infant with prenatal diagnosis of unilateral left ventriculomegaly in which early brain MRI and contrast enhanced-MRI angiography, showed cerebral left hemiatrophy associated with reduced caliber of the left middle cerebral artery revealing the characteristic findings of the Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome. Prenatal imaging, cerebral vascular anomaly responsible for the cerebral hemiatrophy and the early clinical evolution have never been described before in such a young child and complete the acquired clinical descriptions in older children. Differential diagnosis, genetic investigations, neurophysiologic assessments, short term clinical and developmental follow up are described. Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome must be ruled out in differential diagnosis of fetal unilateral ventriculomegaly. Early clinical assessment, differential diagnosis and cerebral imaging including cerebral MRI angiography allow the clinicians to diagnose also in early infancy this rare condition.",
    "Dysregulation of zinc/lipid metabolism - associated genes in the rat hippocampus and cerebral cortex in early adulthood following recurrent neonatal seizures. Although it has been established that recurrent or prolonged clinical seizures during infancy may cause lifelong brain damage, the underlying molecular mechanism is still not well elucidated. The present study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to investigate the expression of twenty zinc (Zn)/lipid metabolism - associated genes in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of rats following recurrent neonatal seizures. In the current study, 6 - day - old Sprague - Dawley rats were randomly divided into control (CONT) and recurrent neonatal seizure (RS) groups. On postnatal day 35 (P35), mossy fiber sprouting and gene expression were assessed by Timm staining and reverse transcription - quantitative polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Of the twenty genes investigated, seven were significantly downregulated, while four were significantly upregulated in the RS group compared with CONT rats, which was observed in the hippocampus but not in the cerebral cortex. Meanwhile, aberrant mossy fiber sprouting was observed in the supragranular region of the dentate gyrus and Cornu Ammonis 3 subfield of the hippocampus in the RS group. In addition, linear correlation analysis identified significant associations between the expression of certain genes in the hippocampus, which accounted for 40% of the total fifty - five gene pairs among the eleven regulated genes. However, only eight gene pairs in the cerebral cortex exhibited significant positive associations, which accounted for 14.5% of the total. The results of the present study indicated the importance of hippocampal Zn/lipid metabolism - associated genes in recurrent neonatal seizure - induced aberrant mossy fiber sprouting, which may aid the identification of novel potential targets during epileptogenesis.",
    "ESET histone methyltransferase is essential to hypertrophic differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes and formation of epiphyseal plates. The ESET (also called SETDB1) protein contains an N-terminal tudor domain that mediates protein-protein interactions and a C-terminal SET domain that catalyzes methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9. We report here that ESET protein is transiently upregulated in prehypertrophic chondrocytes in newborn mice. To investigate the in vivo effects of ESET on chondrocyte differentiation, we generated conditional knockout mice to specifically eliminate the catalytic SET domain of ESET protein only in mesenchymal cells. Such deletion of the ESET gene caused acceleration of chondrocyte hypertrophy in both embryos and young animals, depleting chondrocytes that are otherwise available to form epiphyseal plates for endochondral bone growth. ESET-deficient mice are thus characterized by defective long bone growth and trabecular bone formation. To understand the underlying mechanism for ESET regulation of chondrocytes, we carried out co-expression experiments and found that ESET associates with histone deacetylase 4 to bind and inhibit the activity of Runx2, a hypertrophy-promoting transcription factor. Repression of Runx2-mediated gene transactivation by ESET is dependent on its H3-K9 methyltransferase activity as well as its associated histone deacetylase activity. In addition, knockout of ESET is associated with repression of Indian hedgehog gene in pre- and early hypertrophic chondrocytes. Together, these results provide clear evidence that ESET controls hypertrophic differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes and endochondral ossification during embryogenesis and postnatal development.",
    "Eaf1p Is Required for Recruitment of NuA4 in Targeting TFIID to the Promoters of the Ribosomal Protein Genes for Transcriptional Initiation In Vivo. NuA4 (nucleosome acetyltransferase of H4) promotes transcriptional initiation of TFIID (a complex of TBP and TBP-associated factors [TAFs])-dependent ribosomal protein genes involved in ribosome biogenesis. However, it is not clearly understood how NuA4 regulates the transcription of ribosomal protein genes. Here, we show that NuA4 is recruited to the promoters of ribosomal protein genes, such as RPS5, RPL2B, and RPS11B, for TFIID recruitment to initiate transcription, and the recruitment of NuA4 to these promoters is impaired in the absence of its Eaf1p component. Intriguingly, impaired NuA4 recruitment in a \u0394eaf1 strain depletes recruitment of TFIID (a TAF-dependent form of TBP) but not the TAF-independent form of TBP to the promoters of ribosomal protein genes. However, in the absence of NuA4, SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase) is involved in targeting the TAF-independent form of TBP to the promoters of ribosomal protein genes for transcriptional initiation. Thus, NuA4 plays an important role in targeting TFIID to the promoters of ribosomal protein genes for transcriptional initiation in vivo. Such a function is mediated via its targeted histone acetyltransferase activity. In the absence of NuA4, ribosomal protein genes lose TFIID dependency and become SAGA dependent for transcriptional initiation. Collectively, these results provide significant insights into the regulation of ribosomal protein gene expression and, hence, ribosome biogenesis and functions.",
    "Ecallantide is a novel treatment for attacks of hereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency. Hereditary angioedema (HAE) resulting from the deficiency of the C1 inhibitor protein is a rare disease, characterized by paroxysms of edema formation in the subcutis and in the submucosa. Edema can cause obstruction of the upper airway, which may lead to suffocation. Prompt elimination of edema is necessary to save patients from this life-threatening condition. Essentially, these edematous attacks are related to the activation of the kinin-kallikrein system and the consequent release of bradykinin. Ecallantide (known as DX-88 previously), a potent and specific inhibitor of plasma kallikrein is an innovative medicinal product. This is the only agent approved recently by the FDA for all localizations of edematous HAE attacks. Its advantages include no risk of viral contamination, high selectivity, very rapid onset of action, good tolerability, and straightforward subcutaneous administration. Owing to the risk of anaphylaxis, ecallantide should be administered by a health care professional. A postmarketing survey to improve risk-assessment and risk-minimization has been launched. The results of these studies may lead to the approval of ecallantide for self-administration.",
    "Economic impact of new active substance status on EU payers' budgets: example of dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera(\u00ae)) for multiple sclerosis. BACKGROUND: Recently, collaboration between regulators and payers was set up and was mainly focused on evidence generation along product clinical development. However, neither the regulatory path nor the new active substance status (NASs) was considered. Granting NASs will provide the product with 8 years of data protection and 2 years of market exclusivity during which no generic could enter the market. OBJECTIVE: To review the economic impact (for payers) of NASs granted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for dimethyl fumarate (DMF), developed by Biogen and approved for multiple sclerosis (MS) as Tecfidera(\u00ae) on 3 February 2014. METHOD: We reviewed the available DMF-containing products and identified their indication and price through relevant databases and official Web sites. The economic impact of Tecfidera(\u00ae) on payers' budgets was calculated assuming NASs was or was not granted. The forecast was identified in Datamonitor. RESULTS: Results identified four products already containing DMF as the main or unique active substance. This would have potentially prevented Tecfidera(\u00ae) from being granted NASs. The EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) denied Tecfidera(\u00ae) NASs and, following a company appeal, reversed its position opening as polemic. The impact of that decision has been evaluated at \u20ac7 to \u20ac10 billion over a 10-year period. CONCLUSION: NASs is a critical decision because it does have a major budget impact for payers, and it prevents generic competition. Current European Union (EU) regulations on that topic are unclear and open up too many interpretations thus distorting fair trade and affecting payers' bills. Greater clarity and more stringent rules are required to prevent mistrust of this EMA decision.",
    "Effect of IL-18 binding protein on hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury induced by infrarenal aortic occlusion. PURPOSE: Severe local and systemic tissue damage called ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury occurs during the period of reperfusion. Free oxygen radicals and proinflammatory cytokines are responsible for reperfusion injury. IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) is a natural inhibitor of IL-18. The balance between IL-18 and IL-18BP has an important role in the inflammatory setting. The present study aimed to investigate whether IL-18BP had a protective role in remote organ hepatic IR injury. METHODS: Wistar-Albino rats were divided into three groups that contained seven rats. Group I (sham): Laparotomy and infrarenal abdominal aorta (AA) dissection were done but no clamping was done. Group II (I/R): The infrarenal AA was clamped by atraumatic microvascular clamp for 30 minutes and then was exposed to 90 minutes of reperfusion. Group III (IR + IL-18BP): 75 \u00b5g/kg of IL-18BP in 0.9% saline (1 mL) was administered 30 minutes before infrarenal AA dissection and clamping; 30 minutes of ischemia was applied and then was exposed to 90 minutes of reperfusion. RESULTS: Serum AST, ALT, and LDH levels were remarkably higher in IR group and returned to normal levels in treatment group. The proinflammatory cytokine levels had decreased in treatment group, and was statistically significant compared with the IR group. Serum levels of total oxidant status and oxidative stress index decreased and levels of total antioxidant status increased by IL-18BP. CONCLUSION: This study suggested that IL-18BP has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective effects in cases of IR with infrarenal AA induced liver oxidative damage.",
    "Effect of moderate liver impairment on the pharmacokinetics of opicapone. PURPOSE: Opicapone (OPC) is a novel catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor to be used as adjunctive therapy in levodopa-treated patients with Parkinson's disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of moderate liver impairment on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD; effect on COMT activity) of OPC. METHODS: An open-label, parallel-group study in patients (n = 8) with moderate liver impairment (Child-Pugh category B, score of 7 to 9) and matched healthy subjects (n = 8, control) with normal liver function. All subjects received a single 50-mg oral dose of OPC, with plasma and urine concentrations of opicapone and its metabolites measured up to 72\u00a0h post-dose, including soluble COMT (S-COMT) activity. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the main PK and PD parameters between groups. Point estimates (PE) of geometric mean ratios (GMR) and corresponding 90\u00a0% confidence intervals (90%CI) for the ratio hepatic/control subjects of each parameter were calculated and compared with the reference interval (80-125\u00a0%). RESULTS: Exposure to opicapone (AUC and Cmax) increased significantly in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (PE [90%CI]: AUC0-\u221e, 184\u00a0% [135-250\u00a0%]; Cmax, 189\u00a0% [144-249\u00a0%]). Although apparent total clearance (CL/F) of opicapone was decreased by \u223c35\u00a0%, similar elimination half-life and unbound/bound fractions of opicapone were observed between the two groups. Both rate and extent of exposure to BIA 9-1103 were higher in the hepatically impaired group, but not statistically significant compared with the control group. Similar to the parent (opicapone), the observed increase in exposure to BIA 9-1106 was statistically significant in the hepatically impaired group over the control group. BIA 9-1106 was the only metabolite detected in urine and its urine PK parameters were in accordance with plasma data. Maximum S-COMT inhibition (Emax) occurred earlier for the hepatically impaired group with values of 100\u00a0% and 91.2\u00a0% for the hepatically impaired and control groups respectively. Both Emax and AUEC for the hepatically impaired group reached statistical significance over the control group. OPC was well tolerated in both hepatically impaired and control groups. CONCLUSION: The bioavailability of an orally administered single dose of 50\u00a0mg OPC was significantly higher in patients with moderate chronic hepatic impairment, perhaps by a reduced first-pass effect. As the tolerability profile of OPC was favourable under the conditions of this study and its exposure is completely purged from systemic circulation before the subsequent dose administration, no OPC dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild to moderate chronic hepatic impairment. However, as OPC is under clinical development for use as adjunctive therapy in levodopa-treated patients with Parkinson's disease, an adjustment of levodopa and/or OPC regimens in patients should be carefully considered based on a potentially enhanced levodopa dopaminergic response and the associated tolerability.",
    "Effectiveness of Fractionated Plasma Separation and Absorption as a Treatment for Amanita Phalloides Poisoning. BACKGROUND Fractionated plasma separation and absorption (FPSA) is an extracorporeal liver support method that detoxifies accumulated toxins. There are limited data of its use in the treatment of Amanita phalloides intoxication. The objective of this study was to investigate whether FPSA before liver transplantation improves patients' short-term post liver transplantation survival in Amanita phalloides poisoning. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study population consisted of ten patients who had liver transplantation (LT) due to acute liver failure (ALF) caused by Amanita phalloides poisoning. Six patients were treated with FPSA before liver transplantation. All the patients who were started on FPSA were also placed on the liver transplantation list according to emergent liver transplantation criteria. RESULTS Patients treated with FPSA were in a more severe clinical condition presenting in higher mean MELD, total bilirubin, INR and ammonia along with more frequent hypoglycemia and hepatic encephalopathy grade 3/4. FPSA group had longer mean waiting time on the recipient list (3.5 vs. 1.25 days) but inferior thirty-day survival rate (16.5% vs. 100%). CONCLUSIONS When conservative medical modalities are ineffective, the only treatment for Amanita phalloides poisoning is a liver transplant. Although FPSA treated patients had inferior post-LT survival, FPSA was found to prolong the pre surgical waiting time for critically ill patients, consequently giving a chance of life-saving procedure.",
    "Effects of the dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1/\u03b3 agonist aleglitazar on renal function in patients with stage 3 chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes: a Phase IIb, randomized study. BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease, which substantially increases the risk of cardiovascular disease mortality. This Phase IIb safety study (AleNephro) in patients with stage 3 chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, evaluated the renal effects of aleglitazar, a balanced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1/\u03b3 agonist. METHODS: Patients were randomized to 52 weeks' double-blind treatment with aleglitazar 150 \u03bcg/day (n=150) or pioglitazone 45 mg/day (n=152), followed by an 8-week off-treatment period. The primary endpoint was non-inferiority for the difference between aleglitazar and pioglitazone in percentage change in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline to end of follow-up. Secondary endpoints included change from baseline in estimated glomerular filtration rate and lipid profiles at end of treatment. RESULTS: Mean estimated glomerular filtration rate change from baseline to end of follow-up was -2.7% (95% confidence interval: -7.7, 2.4) with aleglitazar versus -3.4% (95% confidence interval: -8.5, 1.7) with pioglitazone, establishing non-inferiority (0.77%; 95% confidence interval: -4.5, 6.0). Aleglitazar was associated with a 15% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate versus 5.4% with pioglitazone at end of treatment, which plateaued to 8 weeks and was not progressive. Superior improvements in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, with similar effects on glycosylated hemoglobin were observed with aleglitazar versus pioglitazone. No major safety concerns were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The primary endpoint in AleNephro was met, indicating that in stage 3 chronic kidney disease patients with type 2 diabetes, the decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate after 52 weeks' treatment with aleglitazar followed by 8 weeks off-treatment was reversible and comparable (non-inferior) to pioglitazone. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01043029 January 5, 2010.",
    "Effects of the serotonin transporter gene promoter polymorphism on mirtazapine and paroxetine efficacy and adverse events in geriatric major depression. BACKGROUND: The \"long/short\"polymorphism (5HTTLPR) in the promoter of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) has been proposed as a pharmacogenetic marker for antidepressant efficacy. Some but not all studies have found that the short form of 5HTTLPR (S allele) results in decreased efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. OBJECTIVE: To determine if the 5HTTLPR polymorphism influences the efficacy and tolerability of mirtazapine and paroxetine hydrochloride, 2 frequently prescribed antidepressants with differing pharmacologic profiles, in geriatric depression. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized 8-week study. SETTING: Eighteen academic and private outpatient clinics. PATIENTS: We evaluated 246 cognitively intact patients 65 years or older with major depression. INTERVENTIONS: Antidepressant therapy with 15 to 45 mg/d of mirtazapine (n = 124) or 20 to 40 mg/d of paroxetine (n = 122). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 and Geriatric Depression Scale, severity of adverse events and dosing compliance indexes, and discontinuations due to adverse events. Outcome measures were stratified according to 5HTTLPR genotypes. RESULTS: Geriatric Depression Scale scores indicated that S allele carriers treated with paroxetine showed a small impairment in antidepressant response. Among mirtazapine-treated patients, there was little indication that the 5HTTLPR genotype affected antidepressant efficacy. However, the 5HTTLPR polymorphism had a dramatic effect on adverse events. Among paroxetine-treated subjects, S allele carriers experienced more severe adverse events during the course of the study, achieved significantly lower final daily doses, and had more discontinuations at days 14, 21, 28, 42, and 49. Surprisingly, among mirtazapine-treated subjects, S allele carriers had fewer discontinuations due to adverse events, experienced less severe adverse events, and achieved higher final daily doses. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that the S allele of 5HTTLPR at the SLC6A4 locus is associated with a poor outcome after treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. However, the major effect was on the tolerability of these drugs rather than efficacy. Results from mirtazapine-treated patients indicate that the effect of this polymorphism on outcome may depend on the mechanism of antidepressant action.",
    "Efficacy and limitations of transarterial acrylic glue embolization for intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas. The efficacy and limitations of transarterial acrylic glue embolization for the treatment of intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) were investigated. Thirty-four DAVFs treated by transarterial embolization using n-butyl cyanoacrylate were retrospectively reviewed. The locations of DAVFs were the transverse-sigmoid sinus in 11, tentorium in 10, cranial vault in 9, and superior sagittal sinus, jugular bulb, foramen magnum, and middle cranial fossa in 1 each. Borden classification was type I in 7, type II in 3, and type III in 24. Eight patients had undergone prior transvenous coil embolization. Complete obliteration rate was 56% immediately after embolization, 71% at follow-up angiography, and 85% after additional treatments (1 transvenous embolization and 4 direct surgery). Complications occurred in three patients, consisting of asymptomatic vessel perforations during cannulation in two patients and leakage of contrast medium resulting in medullary infarction in one patient. Transarterial glue embolization is highly effective for Borden type III DAVF with direct cortical venous drainage, but has limitations for Borden type I and II DAVFs in which the affected sinus is part of the normal venous circulation. Onyx is a new liquid embolic material and is becoming the treatment of choice for DAVF. The benefits of glue embolization compared to Onyx embolization are high thrombogenicity, and relatively low risks of cranial nerve palsies and of excessive migration into the draining veins of high flow fistula. Transarterial glue embolization continues to be useful for selected patients, and complete cure can be expected in most patients with fewer complications if combined with transvenous embolization or direct surgery.",
    "Efficacy and safety of voretigene neparvovec (AAV2-hRPE65v2) in patients with RPE65-mediated inherited retinal dystrophy: a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial. BACKGROUND: Phase 1 studies have shown potential benefit of gene replacement in RPE65-mediated inherited retinal dystrophy. This phase 3 study assessed the efficacy and safety of voretigene neparvovec in participants whose inherited retinal dystrophy would otherwise progress to complete blindness. METHODS: In this open-label, randomised, controlled phase 3 trial done at two sites in the USA, individuals aged 3 years or older with, in each eye, best corrected visual acuity of 20/60 or worse, or visual field less than 20 degrees in any meridian, or both, with confirmed genetic diagnosis of biallelic RPE65 mutations, sufficient viable retina, and ability to perform standardised multi-luminance mobility testing (MLMT) within the luminance range evaluated, were eligible. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to intervention or control using a permuted block design, stratified by age (<10 years and > 10 years) and baseline mobility testing passing level (pass at > 125 lux vs <125 lux). Graders assessing primary outcome were masked to treatment group. Intervention was bilateral, subretinal injection of 1\u00b75 \u00d7 10 vector genomes of voretigene neparvovec in 0\u00b73 mL total volume. The primary efficacy endpoint was 1-year change in MLMT performance, measuring functional vision at specified light levels. The intention-to-treat (ITT) and modified ITT populations were included in primary and safety analyses. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00999609, and enrolment is complete. FINDINGS: Between Nov 15, 2012, and Nov 21, 2013, 31 individuals were enrolled and randomly assigned to intervention (n=21) or control (n=10). One participant from each group withdrew after consent, before intervention, leaving an mITT population of 20 intervention and nine control participants. At 1 year, mean bilateral MLMT change score was 1\u00b78 (SD 1\u00b71) light levels in the intervention group versus 0\u00b72 (1\u00b70) in the control group (difference of 1\u00b76, 95% CI 0\u00b772-2\u00b741, p=0\u00b70013). 13 (65%) of 20 intervention participants, but no control participants, passed MLMT at the lowest luminance level tested (1 lux), demonstrating maximum possible improvement. No product-related serious adverse events or deleterious immune responses occurred. Two intervention participants, one with a pre-existing complex seizure disorder and another who experienced oral surgery complications, had serious adverse events unrelated to study participation. Most ocular events were mild in severity. INTERPRETATION: Voretigene neparvovec gene replacement improved functional vision in RPE65-mediated inherited retinal dystrophy previously medically untreatable. FUNDING: Spark Therapeutics.",
    "Efficacy and safety profile of evolocumab (AMG145), an injectable inhibitor of the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9: the available clinical evidence. INTRODUCTION: Despite the proven efficacy of statins, they are often reported to be inadequate to achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals (especially in high-risk patients). Moreover, a large number of subjects cannot tolerate statins or full doses of these drugs. Thus, there is a need for additional effective LDL-C reducing agents. AREAS COVERED: Evolocumab (AMG145) is a monoclonal antibody inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 that binds to the liver LDL receptor and prevents it from normal recycling by targeting it for degradation. Phase I and II trials revealed that its subcutaneous injection, either alone or in combination with statins, is able to reduce LDL-C from 40 to 80%, apolipoprotein B100 from 30 to 59% and lipoprotein(a) from 18 to 36% in a dose-dependent manner. The incidence of side effects seems to be low and mainly limited to nasopharyngitis, injection site pain, arthralgia and back pain. EXPERT OPINION: Evolocumab is an innovative powerful lipid-lowering drug, additive to statins and with an apparently large therapeutic range associated to a low rate of mild adverse events. If available data will be confirmed in long-term trials with strong outcomes, Evolocumab will provide an essential tool to treat high-risk patients who need to reach ambitious LDL-C target.",
    "Efficacy, safety and usability of secukinumab administration by autoinjector/pen in psoriasis: a randomized, controlled trial (JUNCTURE). BACKGROUND: Secukinumab is a fully human anti-interleukin-17A monoclonal antibody. OBJECTIVE: Determine the efficacy, safety and usability of secukinumab administered via autoinjector/pen. METHODS: This phase III trial randomized subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis to secukinumab 300 mg, 150 mg or placebo self-injection once weekly to Week 4, then every 4 weeks. Co-primary end points at Week 12 were > 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) and clear/almost clear skin by investigator's global assessment 2011 modified version (IGA mod 2011 0/1). Secondary end points included autoinjector usability, assessed by successful, hazard-free self-injection and subject-reported acceptability on Self-Injection Assessment Questionnaire. RESULTS: Week 12 PASI 75 and IGA mod 2011 0/1 responses were superior with secukinumab 300 mg (86.7% and 73.3%, respectively) and 150 mg (71.7% and 53.3%, respectively) vs. placebo (3.3% and 0%, respectively) (P < 0.0001 for all). All subjects successfully self-administered treatment at Week 1, without critical use-related hazards. Subject acceptability of autoinjector was high throughout 12 weeks. Adverse events were higher with secukinumab (300 mg, 70.0%; 150 mg, 63.9%) vs. placebo (54.1%), with differences largely driven by mild/moderate nasopharyngitis. CONCLUSION: Secukinumab delivered by autoinjector/pen is efficacious, well-tolerated and associated with high usability in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.",
    "Eliglustat compared with imiglucerase in patients with Gaucher's disease type 1 stabilised on enzyme replacement therapy: a phase 3, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial. BACKGROUND: The mainstay of treatment for Gaucher's disease type 1 is alternate-week infusion of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). We investigated whether patients stable on such treatment would remain so after switching to oral eliglustat, a selective inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase. METHODS: In this phase 3, randomised, multinational, open-label, non-inferiority trial, we enrolled adults (aged > 18 years) who had received ERT for 3 years or more for Gaucher's disease. Patients were randomly allocated 2:1 at 39 clinics (stratified by ERT dose; block sizes of four; computer-generated centrally) to receive either oral eliglustat or imiglucerase infusions for 12 months. Participants and investigators were aware of treatment assignment, but the central reader who assessed organ volumes was masked. The composite primary efficacy endpoint was percentage of patients whose haematological variables and organ volumes remained stable for 12 months (ie, haemoglobin decrease not more than 15 g/L, platelet count decrease not more than 25%, spleen volume increase not more than 25%, and liver volume increase not more than 20%, in multiples of normal from baseline). The non-inferiority margin was 25% for eliglustat relative to imiglucerase, assessed in all patients who completed 12 months of treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00943111, and EudraCT, number 2008-005223-28. FINDINGS: Between Sept 15, 2009, and Nov 9, 2011, we randomly allocated 106 (66%) patients to eliglustat and 54 (34%) to imiglucerase. In the per-protocol population, 84 (85%) of 99 patients who completed eliglustat treatment and 44 (94%) of 47 patients who completed imiglucerase treatment met the composite primary endpoint (between-group difference -8\u00b78%; 95% CI -17\u00b76 to 4\u00b72). The lower bound of the 95% CI of -17\u00b76% was within the prespecified threshold for non-inferiority. Dropouts occurred due to palpitations (one patient on eliglustat), myocardial infarction (one patient on eliglustat), and psychotic disorder (one patient on imiglucerase). No deaths occurred. 97 (92%) of 106 patients in the eliglustat group had treatment-emergent adverse events, as did 42 (79%) of 53 in the imiglucerase group (mostly mild or moderate in severity). INTERPRETATION: Oral eliglustat maintained haematological and organ volume stability in adults with Gaucher's disease type 1 already controlled by intravenous ERT and could be a useful therapeutic option.

    "Elotuzumab enhances natural killer cell activation and myeloma cell killing through interleukin-2 and TNF-\u03b1 pathways. Elotuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for signaling lymphocytic activation molecule-F7 (SLAMF7, also known as CS1, CD319, or CRACC) that enhances natural killer (NK) cell-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of SLAMF7-expressing myeloma cells. This study explored the mechanisms underlying enhanced myeloma cell killing with elotuzumab as a single agent and in combination with lenalidomide, to support ongoing phase III trials in patients with relapsed/refractory or newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM). An in vitro peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL)/myeloma cell co-culture model was developed to evaluate the combination of elotuzumab and lenalidomide. Expression of activation markers and adhesion receptors was evaluated by flow cytometry, cytokine expression by Luminex and ELISPOT assays, and cytotoxicity by myeloma cell counts. Elotuzumab activated NK cells and promoted myeloma cell death in PBL/myeloma cell co-cultures. The combination of elotuzumab plus lenalidomide demonstrated superior anti-myeloma activity on established MM xenografts in vivo and in PBL/myeloma cell co-cultures in vitro than either agent alone. The combination enhanced myeloma cell killing by modulating NK cell function that coincided with the upregulation of adhesion and activation markers, including interleukin (IL)-2R\u03b1 expression, IL-2 production by CD3(+)CD56(+) lymphocytes, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 production. In co-culture assays, TNF-\u03b1 directly increased NK cell activation and myeloma cell death with elotuzumab or elotuzumab plus lenalidomide, and neutralizing TNF-\u03b1 decreased NK cell activation and myeloma cell death with elotuzumab. These results demonstrate that elotuzumab activates NK cells and induces myeloma cell death via NK cell-mediated ADCC, which is further enhanced when combined with lenalidomide.",
    "Embryonic signature distinguishes pediatric and adult rhabdoid tumors from other SMARCB1-deficient cancers. Extra-cranial rhabdoid tumors (RT) are highly aggressive malignancies of infancy, characterized by undifferentiated histological features and loss of SMARCB1 expression. The diagnosis is all the more challenging that other poorly differentiated cancers lose SMARCB1 expression, such as epithelioid sarcomas (ES), renal medullary carcinomas (RMC) or undifferentiated chordomas (UC). Moreover, late cases occurring in adults are now increasingly reported, raising the question of differential diagnoses and emphasizing nosological issues. To address this issue, we have analyzed the expression profiles of a training set of 32 SMARCB1-deficient tumors (SDT), with ascertained diagnosis of RT (n = 16, all < 5 years of age), ES (n = 8, all > 10 years of age), UC (n = 3) and RMC (n = 5). As compared with other SDT, RT are characterized by an embryonic signature, and up-regulation of key-actors of de novo DNA methylation processes. Using this signature, we then analysed the expression profiling of 37 SDT to infer the appropriate diagnosis. Thirteen adult onset tumors showed strong similarity with pediatric RT, in spite of older age; by exome sequencing, these tumors also showed genomic features indistinguishable from pediatric RT. In contrary, 8 tumors were reclassified within carcinoma, ES or UC categories, while the remaining could not be related to any of those entities. Our results demonstrate that embryonic signature is shared by all RT, whatever the age at diagnosis; they also illustrate that many adult-onset SDT of ambiguous histological diagnosis are clearly different from RT. Finally, our study paves the way for the routine use of expression-based signatures to give accurate diagnosis of SDT.",
    "Emerging chemical therapies targeting 5-hydroxytryptamine in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neuropsychiatric disorder affecting more than 5 million Americans over age 65. By the year 2050, AD is expected to affect over 30 million. Characterized by neuronal cell death accompanied by the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques, AD results in devastating clinical symptomatology with a lasting psychosocial and financial impact. Studies have shown that the current treatments for AD, cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI's) and NMDA receptor antagonists, have limited efficacy. The 5-HT-6 receptor antagonists Idalopirdine and Intepirdine have shown the most progress in current clinical trials and warrant consideration as emerging treatments for AD. Areas covered: This review discusses 5-HT6 antagonists currently in clinical trials as potential treatments for AD symptomatology and how 5-HT6 physiology may play a positive role in alleviating AD symptom pathophysiology. A literature search using PubMed was conducted using the terms Idalopirdine, Intepirdine, 5-HT-6 antagonist, and AD as keywords. Clinicaltrials.gov and Alzforum were also used to obtain information on clinical trials. Expert opinion: If current Phase-3 trials are positive, 5-HT6 antagonists such as Idalopirdine and Intepirdine may be considered as supplementary treatments to ChEI's and NMDA receptor antagonists for the symptomatic treatment of AD.",
    "Emerging drugs to reduce abnormal \u03b2-amyloid protein in Alzheimer's disease patients. Currently available drugs against Alzheimer's disease (AD) target cholinergic and glutamatergic neurotransmissions without affecting the underlying disease process. Putative disease-modifying drugs are in development and target \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) peptide and tau protein, the principal neurophatological hallmarks of the disease. Areas covered: Phase III clinical studies of emerging anti-A\u03b2 drugs for the treatment of AD were searched in US and EU clinical trial registries and in the medical literature until May 2016. Expert opinion: Drugs in Phase III clinical development for AD include one inhibitor of the \u03b2-secretase cleaving enzyme (BACE) (verubecestat), three anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies (solanezumab, gantenerumab, and aducanumab), an inhibitor of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) (azeliragon) and the combination of cromolyn sodium and ibuprofen (ALZT-OP1). These drugs are mainly being tested in subjects during early phases of AD or in subjects at preclinical stage of familial AD or even in asymptomatic subjects at high risk of developing AD. The hope is to intervene in the disease process when it is not too late. However, previous clinical failures with anti-A\u03b2 drugs and the lack of fully understanding of the pathophysiological role of A\u03b2 in the development of AD, put the new drugs at substantial risk of failure.",

    "Empagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a review of the evidence. OBJECTIVE: To review available studies of empagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor approved in 2014 by the European Commission and the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). DATA SOURCES: PubMed was searched using the search terms empagliflozin, BI 10773, and BI10773, for entries between January 1, 2000, and December 1, 2014. Reference lists from retrieved articles were searched manually for additional peer-reviewed publications. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All publications reporting clinical trials of empagliflozin were eligible for inclusion. DATA SYNTHESIS: Empagliflozin is a new once-daily oral SGLT2 inhibitor with a mechanism of action that is independent of \u03b2-cell function and the insulin pathway. Data from a comprehensive phase III clinical trial program have demonstrated its efficacy as monotherapy, as add-on to other glucose-lowering agents, and in different patient populations. In these studies, empagliflozin resulted in improvements in blood glucose levels as well as reductions in body weight and blood pressure. Empagliflozin was well tolerated and was not associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia versus placebo. CONCLUSION: The oral antidiabetes agent, empagliflozin, can be used as monotherapy or alongside other glucose-lowering treatments, including insulin, to treat T2DM.",
    "Endogenous Drp1 mediates mitochondrial autophagy and protects the heart against energy stress. RATIONALE: Both fusion and fission contribute to mitochondrial quality control. How unopposed fusion affects survival of cardiomyocytes and left ventricular function in the heart is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the role of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), a GTPase that mediates mitochondrial fission, in mediating mitochondrial autophagy, ventricular function, and stress resistance in the heart. METHODS AND RESULTS: Drp1 downregulation induced mitochondrial elongation, accumulation of damaged mitochondria, and increased apoptosis in cardiomyocytes at baseline. Drp1 downregulation also suppressed autophagosome formation and autophagic flux at baseline and in response to glucose deprivation in cardiomyocytes. The lack of lysosomal translocation of mitochondrially targeted Keima indicates that Drp1 downregulation suppressed mitochondrial autophagy. Mitochondrial elongation and accumulation of damaged mitochondria were also observed in tamoxifen-inducible cardiac-specific Drp1 knockout mice. After Drp1 downregulation, cardiac-specific Drp1 knockout mice developed left ventricular dysfunction, preceded by mitochondrial dysfunction, and died within 13 weeks. Autophagic flux is significantly suppressed in cardiac-specific Drp1 knockout mice. Although left ventricular function in cardiac-specific Drp1 heterozygous knockout mice was normal at 12 weeks of age, left ventricular function decreased more severely after 48 hours of fasting, and the infarct size/area at risk after ischemia/reperfusion was significantly greater in cardiac-specific Drp1 heterozygous knockout than in control mice. CONCLUSIONS: Disruption of Drp1 induces mitochondrial elongation, inhibits mitochondrial autophagy, and causes mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby promoting cardiac dysfunction and increased susceptibility to ischemia/reperfusion.",
    "Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidases: biochemistry, physiology and pathology. The human endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase (ERAP) 1 and 2 proteins were initially identified as homologues of human placental leucine aminopeptidase/insulin-regulated aminopeptidase. They are categorized as a unique class of proteases based on their subcellular localization on the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum. ERAPs play an important role in the N-terminal processing of the antigenic precursors that are presented on the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. ERAPs are also implicated in the regulation of a wide variety of physiological phenomena and pathogenic conditions. In this review, the current knowledge on ERAPs is summarized.",
    "Endothelial deletion of Sag/Rbx2/Roc2 E3 ubiquitin ligase causes embryonic lethality and blocks tumor angiogenesis. SAG (Sensitive to Apoptosis Gene), also known as RBX2 or ROC2, is a RING protein required for the activity of Cullin-RING ligase (CRL). Our recent study showed that Sag total knockout caused embryonic lethality at E11.5-12.5 days with associated defects in vasculogenesis. Whether Sag is required for de novo vasculogenesis in embryos and angiogenesis in tumors is totally unknown. Here, we report that Sag endothelial deletion also causes embryonic lethality at E15.5 with poor vasculogenesis. Sag deletion in primary endothelial cells (ECs) or knockdown in MS-1 ECs inhibits migration, proliferation and tube formation, with p27 accumulation being responsible for the suppression of migration and proliferation. Furthermore, Sag deletion significantly inhibits angiogenesis in an in vivo Matrigel plug assay, and tumor angiogenesis and tumorigenesis in a B16F10 melanoma model. Finally, MLN4924, an investigational small molecule inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) that inhibits CRL, suppresses in vitro migration, proliferation and tube formation, as well as in vivo angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. Taken together, our study, using both genetic and pharmaceutical approaches, demonstrates that Sag is essential for embryonic vasculogenesis and tumor angiogenesis, and provides the proof-of-concept evidence that targeting Sag E3 ubiquitin ligase may have clinical value for anti-angiogenesis therapy of human cancer.",
    "Enhancer Sharing Promotes Neighborhoods of Transcriptional Regulation Across Eukaryotes. Enhancers physically interact with transcriptional promoters, looping over distances that can span multiple regulatory elements. Given that enhancer-promoter (EP) interactions generally occur via common protein complexes, it is unclear whether EP pairing is predominantly deterministic or proximity guided. Here, we present cross-organismic evidence suggesting that most EP pairs are compatible, largely determined by physical proximity rather than specific interactions. By reanalyzing transcriptome datasets, we find that the transcription of gene neighbors is correlated over distances that scale with genome size. We experimentally show that nonspecific EP interactions can explain such correlation, and that EP distance acts as a scaling factor for the transcriptional influence of an enhancer. We propose that enhancer sharing is commonplace among eukaryotes, and that EP distance is an important layer of information in gene regulation.",
    "Enzyme replacement therapy with taliglucerase alfa: 36-month safety and efficacy results in adult patients with Gaucher disease previously treated with imiglucerase. Taliglucerase alfa is the first available plant cell-expressed human recombinant therapeutic protein. It is indicated for treatment of patients with type 1 Gaucher disease (GD) in adult and pediatric patients in several countries. Study PB-06-002 examined the safety and efficacy of taliglucerase alfa for 9 months in patients who previously received imiglucerase. The results of adult patients from Study PB-06-002 who continued receiving taliglucerase alfa in extension Study PB-06-003 for up to 36 months are reported here. Eighteen patients received at least one dose of taliglucerase alfa in Study PB-06-003; 10 patients completed 36 total months of therapy, and four patients who transitioned to commercial drug completed 30-33 months of treatment. In patients who completed 36 total months of treatment, mean percent (\u00b1standard error) changes from baseline/time of switch to taliglucerase alfa to 36 months were as follows: hemoglobin concentration, -1.0% (\u00b11.9%; n = 10); platelet count, +9.3% (\u00b19.8%; n = 10); spleen volume measured in multiples of normal (MN), -19.8% (\u00b19.9%; n = 7); liver volume measured in MN, +0.9% (\u00b15.4%; n = 8); chitotriosidase activity, -51.5% (\u00b18.1%; n = 10); and CCL18 concentration, -36.5 (\u00b18.0%; n = 10). Four patients developed antidrug antibodies, including one with evidence of neutralizing activity in vitro. All treatment-related adverse events were mild or moderate and transient. The 36-month results of switching from imiglucerase to taliglucerase alfa treatment in adults with GD provide further data on the clinical safety and efficacy of taliglucerase alfa beyond the initial 9 months of the original study. www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00705939.

    "Epidermal growth factor receptor-directed monoclonal antibodies in nonsmall cell lung cancer: an update. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in many nonsmall cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). Blockade of EGFR by monoclonal antibodies has been studied as a strategy to improve the outcome of first-line chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC. The present review updates the findings from phase III trials. RECENT FINDINGS: Cetuximab improved survival when combined with first-line chemotherapy and this benefit was limited to patients with high EGFR expression in their tumors. A Southwest Oncology Group study currently prospectively evaluates the predictive biomarkers for cetuximab. In the SQUIRE phase III trial, necitumumab added to cisplatin and gemcitabine increased the survival in patients with advanced squamous cell NSCLC. The INSPIRE trial studied chemotherapy with and without necitumumab in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC but was prematurely halted because of increased thromboembolic events with chemotherapy and necitumumab. SUMMARY: EGFR monoclonal antibodies improved the outcome including survival in selected patients with advanced NSCLC. Prospective validation of predictive biomarkers is ongoing.",
    "Epilepsy in Muenke syndrome: FGFR3-related craniosynostosis. Epilepsy, a neurologic disorder characterized by the predisposition to recurrent unprovoked seizures, is reported in more than 300 genetic syndromes. Muenke syndrome is an autosomal-dominant craniosynostosis syndrome characterized by unilateral or bilateral coronal craniosynostosis, hearing loss, intellectual disability, and relatively subtle limb findings such as carpal bone fusion and tarsal bone fusion. Muenke syndrome is caused by a single defining point mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. Epilepsy rarely occurs in individuals with Muenke syndrome, and little detail is reported on types of epilepsy, patient characteristics, and long-term outcomes. We present seven patients with Muenke syndrome and seizures. A review of 789 published cases of Muenke syndrome, with a focus on epilepsy and intracranial anomalies in Muenke syndrome, revealed epilepsy in six patients, with intracranial anomalies in five. The occurrence of epilepsy in Muenke syndrome within our cohort of 58 patients, of whom seven manifested epilepsy, and the intracranial anomalies and epilepsy reported in the literature, suggest that patients with Muenke syndrome may be at risk for epilepsy and intracranial anomalies. Furthermore, the impact of Muenke syndrome on the central nervous system may be greater than previously thought.",
    "Estrogen attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide production in macrophages partially via the nongenomic pathway. Steroid hormones exert genotropic effects through members of the nuclear hormone receptor family. In the present study, we examined the effects of 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) on nitric oxide (NO) production following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation and investigated the mechanisms in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs). E2 alone did not affect NO production. In contrast, E2 inhibited LPS-induced production of NO in BMMs. Using a cell-impermeable E2 conjugated to BSA (E2-BSA), which has been used to investigate the nongenomic effects of estrogen, we found that the increase in NO production induced by LPS was also attenuated. In addition, the intracellular estrogen receptor blocker, ICI 182780, only partially antagonized the total effects of E2 on LPS-stimulated NO production capacity. E2 also attenuated the LPS activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) but not that of extracellular-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). This attenuation was not abrogated by ICI 182780. Moreover, the p38 inhibitor, SB 203580, greatly reduced the LPS-induced NO production, and the remaining NO levels were no longer regulated by E2. Additionally, E2-BSA inhibited LPS-mediated changes in p38 MAPK activation to the same extent as E2. Moreover, E2 and E2-BSA inhibited LPS-induced activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1). This inhibitory effect of E2 was only partially antagonized by ICI 182780. Taken together, these results suggest that E2 has an inhibitory effect on LPS-induced NO production in BMMs through inhibition of p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and blockade of NF-\u03baB and AP-1 activation. These effects are mediated at least in part via a nongenomic pathway.",
    "Eukaryotic DNA Replication Fork. This review focuses on the biogenesis and composition of the eukaryotic DNA replication fork, with an emphasis on the enzymes that synthesize DNA and repair discontinuities on the lagging strand of the replication fork. Physical and genetic methodologies aimed at understanding these processes are discussed. The preponderance of evidence supports a model in which DNA polymerase \u03b5 (Pol \u03b5) carries out the bulk of leading strand DNA synthesis at an undisturbed replication fork. DNA polymerases \u03b1 and \u03b4 carry out the initiation of Okazaki fragment synthesis and its elongation and maturation, respectively. This review also discusses alternative proposals, including cellular processes during which alternative forks may be utilized, and new biochemical studies with purified proteins that are aimed at reconstituting leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis separately and as an integrated replication fork.",
    "Evaluation of the oral direct factor Xa inhibitor - betrixaban. INTRODUCTION: For over 60 years vitamin K antagonists have been the mainstay of oral therapy for treatment and prevention of venous and arterial thromboembolic disease. The emergence of two new classes of orally administered anticoagulants, direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors have drastically changed the landscape in the management of these disease states. Betrixaban , an orally administered direct factor Xa inhibitor, is entering a Phase III trial and undergoing investigation for similar indications as apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban. AREAS COVERED: The chemical development of betrixaban, pharmacokinetic differences between betrixaban and currently available novel anticoagulants and future considerations for clinical use. EXPERT OPINION: Betrixaban, the fifth novel oral anticoagulant in line for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, possesses some unique pharmacokinetic characteristics in comparison with the currently available novel anticoagulants, including limited renal excretion, minimal metabolism through the cytochrome p450 system and a long half-life. This pharmacokinetic profile may allow greater flexibility for use in patients with poor renal function, offer the convenience of once daily dosing, and exhibit less drug interactions. Betrixaban is currently being evaluated for prophylaxis against venous thromboembolic disease (VTED) and the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism associated with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, its role in the management of acute VTED and acute coronary syndromes is yet to be defined based on clinical data and evaluation. Of interest, a factor Xa decoy, PRT4445, is currently under evaluation in conjunction with betrixaban, and may be a universal reversal agent for all anticoagulants with anti-Xa activity. Currently, there are no specific reversal agents for the novel anticoagulants. The availability of an effective reversal agent would be very attractive for the management of associated bleeding, bleeding due to trauma, or the need for emergent surgery.",
    "Exogenous coproporphyrin III production by Corynebacterium aurimucosum and Microbacterium oxydans in erythrasma lesions. Erythrasma is a superficial skin disease caused by Gram-positive Corynebacterium species. Coral-red fluorescence under Wood's light, strongly suggestive of erythrasma, can be attributed to the presence of porphyrins. Fractionated porphyrin analysis in erythrasma lesions is yet to be reported. We attempted to investigate erythrasma lesions by isolating the responsible bacteria and determining their exogenous porphyrin production by HPLC analysis. We observed a 78-year-old woman with erythrasma who had a well-demarcated slightly scaling patch on her left foot, between the fourth and fifth toes. Two kinds of colonies on 5 % sheep blood agar were obtained from this lesion. Analysis of the 16S rRNA sequence revealed the colonies to be Corynebacterium aurimucosum and Microbacterium oxydans. HPLC analysis demonstrated that coproporphyrin III (Copro III) levels were clearly elevated, although the amounts of protoporphyrin were diminished. These results indicate that the fluorescent substance was Copro III. This study supports the view that excess Copro III synthesis by C. aurimucosum and M. oxydans leads to accumulation of porphyrin in cutaneous tissue, which emits a coral-red fluorescence when exposed to Wood's light.",
    "Expression characteristics of the SUMOylation genes SUMO-1 and Ubc9 in the developing testis and ovary of Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis. The small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) pathway in eukaryotes is an essential post-translational modification required for a variety of cellular processes, development and organelle biogenesis. SUMO-conjugating enzyme (Ubc9) is an important conjunction enzyme in the SUMO pathway. SUMO-1 and Ubc9 have been found in vertebrates; however, their expression in crustaceans was poorly characterized. In this study, the SUMO-1 and Ubc9 genes were identified in the developing testis and ovary of Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis, and designated EsSUMO-1 and EsUbc9, respectively. Quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated the expression level of both mRNAs varied significantly during testis and ovary development. In the testis, EsSUMO-1 and EsUbc9 were expressed at moderate levels in stage II-1, increased at stage II-2, and then gradually declined in stage IV. In the ovary, EsSUMO-1 and EsUbc9 expression were low in the early stage, reach the highest level at stage III-2, and then gradually decreased in stage IV. Transcripts from both genes were detected using in situ hybridization throughout the testis and ovary, in the spermatids and oocytes. The pattern of EsSUMO-1 and EsUbc9 expression in the testis and ovary suggests that SUMOylation may play an important role in spermatogenesis and oogenesis in E. sinensis.",
    "Facial nerve preservation surgery for koos grade 3 and 4 vestibular schwannomas. BACKGROUND: Facial nerve preservation surgery for large vestibular schwannomas is a novel strategy for maintaining normal nerve function by allowing residual tumor adherent to this nerve or root-entry zone. OBJECTIVE: To report, in a retrospective study, outcomes for large Koos grade 3 and 4 vestibular schwannomas. METHODS: After surgical treatment for vestibular schwannomas in 52 patients (2004-2013), outcomes included extent of resection, postoperative hearing, and facial nerve function. Extent of resection defined as gross total, near total, or subtotal were 7 (39%), 3 (17%), and 8 (44%) in 18 patients after retrosigmoid approaches, respectively, and 10 (29.5%), 9 (26.5%), and 15 (44%) for 34 patients after translabyrinthine approaches, respectively. RESULTS: Hearing was preserved in 1 (20%) of 5 gross total, 0 of 2 near-total, and 1 (33%) of 3 subtotal resections. Good long-term facial nerve function (House-Brackmann grades of I and II) was achieved in 16 of 17 gross total (94%), 11 of 12 near-total (92%), and 21 of 23 subtotal (91%) resections. Long-term tumor control was 100% for gross total, 92% for near-total, and 83% for subtotal resections. Postoperative radiation therapy was delivered to 9 subtotal resection patients and 1 near-total resection patient. Follow-up averaged 33 months. CONCLUSION: Our findings support facial nerve preservation surgery in becoming the new standard for acoustic neuroma treatment. Maximizing resection and close postoperative radiographic follow-up enable early identification of tumors that will progress to radiosurgical treatment. This sequential approach can lead to combined optimal facial nerve function and effective tumor control rates.",
    "Fanconi anemia protein FANCD2 promotes immunoglobulin gene conversion and DNA repair through a mechanism related to homologous recombination. Recent studies show overlap between Fanconi anemia (FA) proteins and those involved in DNA repair mediated by homologous recombination (HR). However, the mechanism by which FA proteins affect HR is unclear. FA proteins (FancA/C/E/F/G/L) form a multiprotein complex, which is responsible for DNA damage-induced FancD2 monoubiquitination, a key event for cellular resistance to DNA damage. Here, we show that FANCD2-disrupted DT40 chicken B-cell line is defective in HR-mediated DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, as well as gene conversion at the immunoglobulin light-chain locus, an event also mediated by HR. Gene conversions occurring in mutant cells were associated with decreased nontemplated mutations. In contrast to these defects, we also found increased spontaneous sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and intact Rad51 foci formation after DNA damage. Thus, we propose that FancD2 promotes a subpathway of HR that normally mediates gene conversion by a mechanism that avoids crossing over and hence SCEs.",
    "Fanconi anemia protein, FANCA, associates with BRG1, a component of the human SWI/SNF complex. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disorder that predisposes to hematopoietic failure, birth defects and cancer. We identified an interaction between the FA protein, FANCA and brm-related gene 1 (BRG1) product. BRG1 is a subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, which remodels chromatin structure through a DNA-dependent ATPase activity. FANCA was demonstrated to associate with the endogenous SWI/SNF complex. We also found a significant increase in the molecular chaperone, glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94) among BRG1-associated factors isolated from a FANCA-mutant cell line, which was not seen in either a normal control cell line or the mutant line complemented by wild-type FANCA. Despite this specific difference, FANCA did not appear to be absolutely required for in vitro chromatin remodeling. Finally, we demonstrated co-localization in the nucleus between transfected FANCA and BRG1. The physiological action of FANCA on the SWI/SNF complex remains to be clarified, but our work suggests that FANCA may recruit the SWI/SNF complex to target genes, thereby enabling coupled nuclear functions such as transcription and DNA repair.",
    "Fanconi anemia: at the crossroads of DNA repair. Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal disorder that causes genome instability. FA patients suffer developmental abnormalities, early-onset bone marrow failure, and a predisposition to cancer. The disease is manifested by defects in DNA repair, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, and a high degree of chromosomal aberrations. The FA pathway comprises 13 disease-causing genes involved in maintaining genomic stability. The fast pace of study of the novel DNA damage network has led to the constant discovery of new FA-like genes involved in the pathway that when mutated lead to similar disorders. A majority of the FA proteins act as signal transducers and scaffolding proteins to employ other pathways to repair DNA. This review discusses what is known about the FA proteins and other recently linked FA-like proteins. The goal is to clarify how the proteins work together to carry out interstrand crosslink repair and homologous recombination-mediated repair of damaged DNA.",
    "Ficolins and the lectin pathway of complement in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. The complement system plays a pathophysiological role in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This study aims to investigate whether an association exists between the ficolins that are part of the lectin complement pathway and SLE. EDTA plasma samples from 68 Danish SLE patients and 29 healthy donors were included in the study. Plasma concentrations of Ficolin-1, -2, and -3 were determined in specific sandwich ELISAs. Lectin pathway activity via Ficolin-3 was measured in ELISA on acetylated bovine serum albumin (acBSA) and measured as Ficolin-3 binding and deposition of C4, C3 and the terminal complement complex (TCC). SLE patients had increased levels of Ficolin-3, 21.6\u03bcg/ml as compared to 17.0\u03bcg/ml in healthy controls (P=0.0098). The Ficolin-1 plasma concentration was negatively correlated with SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) (Rho=-0.29, P=0.015) and positively correlated to the [Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Damage Index] (SDI) (Rho=0.27, P=0.026). The Ficolin-1 concentration was also associated with the occurrence of arterial (P=0.0053) but not venous thrombosis (P=0.42). Finally, deposition of C4, C3 and TCC in the Ficolin-3 pathway were all correlated to SLEDAI, respectively (P<0.0076). The Ficolin-1 association to SLEDAI and SDI as well as arterial thrombosis shown in this study suggests that Ficolin-1 may be a potential new biomarker for patients with SLE. Furthermore, Ficolin-3 mediated complement activation may be valuable in monitoring disease activity in SLE patients due to the high sensitivity for complement consumption in the assay independent of the Ficolin-3 concentration.",
    "Fine-Tuning Circadian Rhythms: The Importance of Bmal1 Expression in the Ventral Forebrain. Although, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus acts as the central clock in mammals, the circadian expression of clock genes has been demonstrated not only in the SCN, but also in peripheral tissues and brain regions outside the SCN. However, the physiological roles of extra-SCN circadian clocks in the brain remain largely elusive. In response, we generated Nkx2.1-Bmal1 mice in which Bmal1, an essential clock component, was genetically deleted specifically in the ventral forebrain, including the preoptic area, nucleus of the diagonal band, and most of the hypothalamus except the SCN. In these mice, as expected, PER2::LUC oscillation was drastically attenuated in the explants of mediobasal hypothalamus, whereas it was maintained in those of the SCN. Although, Nkx2.1-Bmal1 mice were rhythmic and nocturnal, they showed altered patterns of locomotor activity during the night in a 12:12-h light:dark cycle and during subjective night in constant darkness. Control mice were more active during the first half than the second half of the dark phase or subjective night, whereas Nkx2.1-Bmal1 mice showed the opposite pattern of locomotor activity. Temporal patterns of sleep-wakefulness and feeding also changed accordingly. Such results suggest that along with mechanisms in the SCN, local Bmal1-dependent clocks in the ventral forebrain are critical for generating precise temporal patterns of circadian behaviors.",
    "Fine-needle aspiration cytology yield as a basis for morphological, molecular, and cytogenetic diagnosis in alk-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma with atypical clinical presentation. ALK positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a T-cell lymphoma usually occurring in children and young adults. It frequently involves lymph nodes and extranodal sites and is associated with favorable prognosis. A 20-year old man was admitted for painful mass in the left axilla with overlying skin redness. Clinical presentation and US findings were highly suspicious for sarcoma. Definitive diagnosis was established cytolologically and using ancillary technologies from cytological samples. Fine needle aspiration cytology of tumor mass (lymph node conglomerate and surrounding tissue) show predominance of large, pleomorphic, atypical cells with large nuclei and vacuolised cytoplasm. Atypical cells immunocytochemically were positive for LCA, CD30, CD3, EMA, and ALK; negative for CD15 and CD56. NPM-ALK transcript was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCT). Molecular analysis of TCR\u00df and TCR\u03b3 genes demonstrated clonal TCR genes rearrangement. Complex karyotype with multiple numerical and structural changes was found on conventional cytogenetics. These findings excluded sarcoma and corroborated the diagnosis of ALK positive ALCL. Cutaneous involvement in ALCL can clinically mimic sarcoma, especially in cases with localized disease without B symptoms. In those cases, immunostaining, PCR, and conventional cytogenetics are helpful to exclude sarcoma. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2017;45:51-54. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",
    "Flumazenil use in benzodiazepine overdose in the UK: a retrospective survey of NPIS data. OBJECTIVE: Benzodiazepine (BZD) overdose (OD) continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality in the UK. Flumazenil is an effective antidote but there is a risk of seizures, particularly in those who have co-ingested tricyclic antidepressants. A study was undertaken to examine the frequency of use, safety and efficacy of flumazenil in the management of BZD OD in the UK. METHODS: A 2-year retrospective cohort study was performed of all enquiries to the UK National Poisons Information Service involving BZD OD. RESULTS: Flumazenil was administered to 80 patients in 4504 BZD-related enquiries, 68 of whom did not have ventilatory failure or had recognised contraindications to flumazenil. Factors associated with flumazenil use were increased age, severe poisoning and ventilatory failure. Co-ingestion of tricyclic antidepressants and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease did not influence flumazenil administration. Seizure frequency in patients not treated with flumazenil was 0.3%. The frequency of prior seizure in flumazenil-treated patients was 30 times higher (8.8%). Seven patients who had seizures prior to flumazenil therapy had no recurrence of their seizures. Ventilation or consciousness improved in 70% of flumazenil-treated patients. Flumazenil administration was followed by one instance each of agitation and brief seizure. CONCLUSIONS: Flumazenil is used infrequently in the management of BZD OD in the UK. It was effective and associated with a low incidence of seizure. These results compare favourably with the results of published randomised controlled trials and cohort studies, although previous studies have not reported the use of flumazenil in such a high-risk population. This study should inform the continuing review of national guidance on flumazenil therapy.",
    "Formin Is Associated with Left-Right Asymmetry in the Pond Snail and the Frog. While components of the pathway that establishes left-right asymmetry have been identified in diverse animals, from vertebrates to flies, it is striking that the genes involved in the first symmetry-breaking step remain wholly unknown in the most obviously chiral animals, the gastropod snails. Previously, research on snails was used to show that left-right signaling of Nodal, downstream of symmetry breaking, may be an ancestral feature of the Bilateria [1 and 2]. Here, we report that a disabling mutation in one copy of a tandemly duplicated, diaphanous-related formin is perfectly associated with symmetry breaking in the pond snail. This is supported by the observation that an anti-formin drug treatment converts dextral snail embryos to a sinistral phenocopy, and in frogs, drug inhibition or overexpression by microinjection of formin has a chirality-randomizing effect in early (pre-cilia) embryos. Contrary to expectations based on existing models [3, 4 and 5], we discovered asymmetric gene expression in 2- and 4-cell snail embryos, preceding morphological asymmetry. As the formin-actin filament has been shown to be part of an asymmetry-breaking switch in vitro [6 and 7], together these results are consistent with the view that animals with diverse body plans may derive their asymmetries from the same intracellular chiral elements [8].",
    "Francisella tularensis aortitis. Francisella tularensis, the agent of tularemia, is a Gram-negative coccobacillus primarily pathogen for animals and occasionally for humans. The clinical manifestations of tularemia include pneumonia, ulceroglandular, oropharyngeal, or typhoidal disease. Rare manifestations are also described, but to our knowledge, we describe here the first case of F. tularensis aortitis in a human. Diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of F. tularensis in blood culture, by the presence of F. tularensis DNA in the aortic biopsy and by specific IgG and IgM responses against the bacteria. The outcome was favorable after surgery and specific antimicrobial therapy.",
    "From explosions to black lung: a history of efforts to control coal mine dust. Highlights in the history of efforts to prevent occupational lung disease among coal miners in the United States are reviewed. The Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 is summarized, and the sources and effects of its provisions to prevent coal workers' pneumoconiosis are examined. Descriptions follow of the identification of coal workers' pneumoconiosis as a disease, identification of respirable coal mine dust as its cause, and establishment and enforcement of an exposure limit. The development of prevention efforts focusing on surveillance of both exposure and outcome and of enforcement of dust control methods is examined.",
    "From tall to short: the role of TGF\u03b2 signaling in growth and its disorders. The acromelic dysplasia group is characterized by short stature, short hands and feet, stiff joint, and \"muscular\" build. Four disorders can now be ascribed to this group, namely Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS), geleophysic dysplasia (GD), acromicric dysplasia (AD), and Myhre syndrome (MS). Although closely similar, they can be distinguished by subtle clinical features and their pattern inheritance. WMS is characterized by the presence of dislocation of microspherophakia and has autosomal dominant or recessive mode of inheritance. GD is the more severe one, with a progressive cardiac valvular thickening, tracheal stenosis, bronchopulmonary insufficiency, often leading to an early death. AD has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, distinct facial and skeleton features (a hoarse voice and internal notch of the femoral head). Finally, MS is sporadic, characterized by prognathism, deafness, developmental delay, thickened calvarium, and large vertebrae with short and large pedicles. We first identified mutations in Fibrillin-1 (FBN1) in the dominant form of WMS and then mutations in A Disintegrin-like And Metalloproteinase domain with ThromboSpondin type 1 repeats 10 (ADAMTS10) in the recessive form of WMS. The function of ADAMTS10 is unknown but these findings support a direct interaction between ADAMTS10 and FBN1. We then identified mutations in ADAMTSL2 in the recessive form of GD and a hotspot of mutations in FBN1 in the dominant form of GD and in AD (exon 41-42, encoding TGF\u03b2 binding protein-like domain 5 (TB5) of FBN1). The function of ADAMTSL2 is unknown. Using a yeast double hybrid screen, we identified latent transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) binding protein 1 as a partner of ADAMTSL2. We found an increased level of active TGF\u03b2 in the fibroblast medium from patients with FBN1 or ADAMTSL2 mutations and an enhanced phosphorylated SMAD2 level, allowing us to conclude at an enhanced TGF\u03b2 signaling in GD and AD. Finally, a direct interaction between ADAMTSL2 and FBN1 was demonstrated suggesting a dysregulation of FBN1/ADAMTSL2 interrelationship as the underlying mechanism of the short stature phenotypes. Using exome sequencing in MS probands, we identified de novo SMAD4 missense mutations, all involving isoleucine residue at position 500, in the MH2 domain. In MS fibroblasts, we found decreased ubiquitination level of SMAD4 and increased level of SMAD4 supporting a stabilization of SMAD4 protein. Functional SMAD4 is required for canonical signal transduction through the oligomerization with phosphorylated SMAD2/3 and SMAD1/5/8. We therefore studied the nuclear localization of mutant SMAD complexes and found that the complexes translocate to the nucleus. We finally observed a decreased expression of downstream TGF\u03b2 target genes supporting impaired TGF\u03b2 driven transcriptional control in MS. Our findings support a direct link between the short stature phenotypes and the TGF\u03b2 signaling. However, the finding of enhanced TGF\u03b2 signaling in Marfan phenotypes supports the existence of yet unknown mechanisms regulating TGF\u03b2 action.",
    "Frontal hypometabolism in elderly breast cancer survivors determined by [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET): a pilot study. PURPOSE: The term \"chemobrain\" is sometimes used to denote deficits in neuropsychological functioning that may occur as a result of cancer treatment. As breast cancer survivors now commonly reach late life, it is not known whether previous exposure to chemotherapy may affect long-term risk for cognitive impairment. To help address this concern, this study tested whether successfully surviving chemotherapy earlier in life was associated with later differences in brain metabolic function as an older adult compared to controls. This question was examined using positron emission tomography measures of brain glucose metabolism in elderly women cancer survivors. METHODS: Breast cancer survivors (N = 10), currently free of recurrent cancer and without a diagnosis of a cognitive disorder, were compared to matched healthy controls (N = 10). All subjects were imaged at rest with [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose. Images were analyzed semi-quantitatively using the Alzheimer's Discrimination Tool and a volume of interest-based approach derived from co-registered magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Relative [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake (normalized to global) was significantly lower in the survivors compared with control subjects in bilateral orbital frontal regions, consistent with differences between the groups in cognition and executive function (i.e., Trail Making Test, Part B and mini-mental state examination) and despite no significant differences with respect to age, education, intelligence, or working memory. None of the survivors and only one control manifested a global positron emission tomography score consistent with an Alzheimer's disease metabolic pattern. CONCLUSION: Breast cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy may manifest long-term changes in brain glucose metabolism indicative of subtle frontal hypometabolism, a finding consistent with results from neuropsychological testing and other imaging modalities.",
    "FullSSR: Microsatellite Finder and Primer Designer. Microsatellites are genomic sequences comprised of tandem repeats of short nucleotide motifs widely used as molecular markers in population genetics. FullSSR is a new bioinformatic tool for microsatellite (SSR) loci detection and primer design using genomic data from NGS assay. The software was tested with 2000 sequences of Oryza sativa shotgun sequencing project from the National Center of Biotechnology Information Trace Archive and with partial genome sequencing with ROCHE 454\u00ae from Caiman latirostris, Salvator merianae, Aegla platensis, and Zilchiopsis collastinensis. FullSSR performance was compared against other similar SSR search programs. The results of the use of this kind of approach depend on the parameters set by the user. In addition, results can be affected by the analyzed sequences because of differences among the genomes. FullSSR simplifies the detection of SSRs and primer design on a big data set. The command line interface of FullSSR was intended to be used as part of genomic analysis tools pipeline; however, it can be used as a stand-alone program because the results are easily interpreted for a nonexpert user.",
    "Functional analysis of Rfx6 and mutant variants associated with neonatal diabetes. Mutations in rfx6 were recently associated with Mitchell-Riley syndrome, which involves neonatal diabetes, and other digestive system defects. To better define the function of Rfx6 in early endoderm development we cloned the Xenopus homologue. Expression of rfx6 begins early, showing broad expression throughout the anterior endoderm; at later stages rfx6 expression becomes restricted to the endocrine cells of the gut and pancreas. Morpholino knockdown of rfx6 caused a loss of pancreas marker expression, as well as other abnormalities. Co-injection of exogenous wild-type rfx6 rescued the morpholino phenotype in Xenopus tadpoles, whereas attempts to rescue the loss-of-function phenotype using mutant rfx6 based on Mitchell-Riley patients were unsuccessful. To better define the pleiotropic effects, we performed microarray analyses of gene expression in knockdown foregut tissue. In addition to pancreatic defects, the microarray analyses revealed downregulation of lung, stomach and heart markers and an upregulation of kidney markers. We verified these results using RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. Based on the different rfx6 expression patterns and our functional analyses, we propose that rfx6 has both early and late functions. In early development Rfx6 plays a broad role, being essential for development of most anterior endodermal organs. At later stages however, Rfx6 function is restricted to endocrine cells.",
    "Functional asymmetry and electron flow in the bovine respirasome. Respirasomes are macromolecular assemblies of the respiratory chain complexes I, III and IV in the inner mitochondrial membrane. We determined the structure of supercomplex IIIIIV from bovine heart mitochondria by cryo-EM at 9 \u00c5 resolution. Most protein-protein contacts between complex I, III and IV in the membrane are mediated by supernumerary subunits. Of the two Rieske iron-sulfur cluster domains in the complex III dimer, one is resolved, indicating that this domain is immobile and unable to transfer electrons. The central position of the active complex III monomer between complex I and IV in the respirasome is optimal for accepting reduced quinone from complex I over a short diffusion distance of 11 nm, and delivering reduced cytochrome c to complex IV. The functional asymmetry of complex III provides strong evidence for directed electron flow from complex I to complex IV through the active complex III monomer in the mammalian supercomplex.",
    "Further delineation of the phenotype resulting from BRAF or MEK1 germline mutations helps differentiate cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome from Costello syndrome. Because Cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome has significant phenotypic overlap with Costello syndrome, it may be difficult to establish the diagnosis on a clinical basis. The recent discoveries of germline HRAS mutations in patients with Costello syndrome and mutations in BRAF, MEK1, and MEK2 in CFC syndrome uncovered the biologic mechanism for the shared phenotypic findings based on the close interaction of the affected gene products within the MAP kinase pathway. We evaluated a series of patients who were either clinically diagnosed with Costello syndrome, or in whom the diagnoses of both Costello and CFC syndromes were considered. After excluding mutations in HRAS, we identified eight changes in BRAF and five in MEK1. Five mutations are novel, and all changes occurred de novo among those triads tested. A review of the clinical abnormalities showed important differences between patients with either a BRAF or MEK1 mutation, and those previously reported with an HRAS mutation. Statistical significance was achieved, despite the relatively small number of patients with BRAF and MEK1 mutations reported here, for polyhydramnios, growth hormone deficiency and the presence of more than one papilloma, which were less common in CFC compared to HRAS mutation positive patients. Although both CFC and Costello syndrome are characterized by cardiac abnormalities in about three-fourths of patients, the pattern of congenital heart defects (CHD), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and tachycardia differs somewhat. CHD, especially pulmonic stenosis associated with a secundum-type atrial septal defect, are more common in CFC than Costello syndrome (P = 0.02). Atrial tachycardia is less frequent in CFC patients with BRAF or MEK1 mutations, compared to Costello syndrome patients with HRAS mutation (P = 0.04). Chaotic atrial rhythm or multifocal atrial tachycardia was observed only in Costello syndrome. Malignant tumors have been viewed as characteristic for Costello syndrome due to HRAS mutations, however, we report here on a MEK1 mutation in a patient with a malignant tumor, a hepatoblastoma. Although this indicates that the presence of a tumor is not specific for Costello syndrome with HRAS mutation, it is noteworthy that the tumor histology differs from those commonly seen in Costello syndrome. Based on these clinical differences we suggest that patients with BRAF and MEK mutations should be diagnosed with CFC syndrome, and the diagnosis of Costello syndrome be reserved for patients with HRAS mutations.",
    "G-protein-coupled receptor-2-interacting protein-1 is required for endothelial cell directional migration and tumor angiogenesis via cortactin-dependent lamellipodia formation. OBJECTIVE: Recent evidence suggests G-protein-coupled receptor-2-interacting protein-1 (GIT1) overexpression in several human metastatic tumors, including breast, lung, and prostate. Tumor metastasis is associated with an increase in angiogenesis. We have showed previously that GIT1 is required for postnatal angiogenesis during lung development. However, the functional role of GIT1 in pathological angiogenesis during tumor growth is unknown. APPROACH AND RESULTS: In the present study, we show inhibition of angiogenesis in matrigel implants as well as reduced tumor angiogenesis and melanoma tumor growth in GIT1-knockout mice. We demonstrate that this is a result of impaired directional migration of GIT1-depleted endothelial cells toward a vascular endothelial growth factor gradient. Cortactin-mediated lamellipodia formation in the leading edge is critical for directional migration. We observed a significant reduction in cortactin localization and lamellipodia formation in the leading edge of GIT1-depleted endothelial cells. We specifically identified that the Spa homology domain (aa 250-420) of GIT1 is required for GIT1-cortactin complex localization to the leading edge. The mechanisms involved extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2-mediated Cortactin-S405 phosphorylation and activation of Rac1/Cdc42. Finally, using gain of function studies, we show that a constitutively active mutant of cortactin restored directional migration of GIT1-depleted cells. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated that a GIT1-cortactin association through GIT1-Spa homology domain is required for cortactin localization to the leading edge and is essential for endothelial cell directional migration and tumor angiogenesis.",
    "GBshape: a genome browser database for DNA shape annotations. Many regulatory mechanisms require a high degree of specificity in protein-DNA binding. Nucleotide sequence does not provide an answer to the question of why a protein binds only to a small subset of the many putative binding sites in the genome that share the same core motif. Whereas higher-order effects, such as chromatin accessibility, cooperativity and cofactors, have been described, DNA shape recently gained attention as another feature that fine-tunes the DNA binding specificities of some transcription factor families. Our Genome Browser for DNA shape annotations (GBshape; freely available at http://rohslab.cmb.usc.edu/GBshape/) provides minor groove width, propeller twist, roll, helix twist and hydroxyl radical cleavage predictions for the entire genomes of 94 organisms. Additional genomes can easily be added using the GBshape framework. GBshape can be used to visualize DNA shape annotations qualitatively in a genome browser track format, and to download quantitative values of DNA shape features as a function of genomic position at nucleotide resolution. As biological applications, we illustrate the periodicity of DNA shape features that are present in nucleosome-occupied sequences from human, fly and worm, and we demonstrate structural similarities between transcription start sites in the genomes of four Drosophila species.",
    "GFRAL is the receptor for GDF15 and is required for the anti-obesity effects of the ligand. Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15; also known as MIC-1) is a divergent member of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily and is associated with body-weight regulation in humans and rodents. However, the cognate receptor of GDF15 is unknown. Here we show that GDF15 binds specifically to GDNF family receptor \u03b1-like (GFRAL) with high affinity, and that GFRAL requires association with the coreceptor RET to elicit intracellular signaling in response to GDF15 stimulation. We also found that GDF15-mediated reductions in food intake and body weight of mice with obesity were abolished in GFRAL-knockout mice. We further found that GFRAL expression was limited to hindbrain neurons and not present in peripheral tissues, which suggests that GDF15-GFRAL-mediated regulation of food intake is by a central mechanism. Lastly, given that GDF15 did not increase energy expenditure in treated mice with obesity, the anti-obesity actions of the cytokine are likely driven primarily by a reduction in food intake.",
    "GFRAL is the receptor for GDF15 and the ligand promotes weight loss in mice and nonhuman primates. Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), a distant member of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 family, is a secreted protein that circulates as a 25-kDa dimer. In humans, elevated GDF15 correlates with weight loss, and the administration of GDF15 to mice with obesity reduces body weight, at least in part, by decreasing food intake. The mechanisms through which GDF15 reduces body weight remain poorly understood, because the cognate receptor for GDF15 is unknown. Here we show that recombinant GDF15 induces weight loss in mice fed a high-fat diet and in nonhuman primates with spontaneous obesity. Furthermore, we find that GDF15 binds with high affinity to GDNF family receptor \u03b1-like (GFRAL), a distant relative of receptors for a distinct class of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily ligands. Gfral is expressed in neurons of the area postrema and nucleus of the solitary tract in mice and humans, and genetic deletion of the receptor abrogates the ability of GDF15 to decrease food intake and body weight in mice. In addition, diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance are exacerbated in GFRAL-deficient mice, suggesting a homeostatic role for this receptor in metabolism. Finally, we demonstrate that GDF15-induced cell signaling requires the interaction of GFRAL with the coreceptor RET. Our data identify GFRAL as a new regulator of body weight and as the bona fide receptor mediating the metabolic effects of GDF15, enabling a more comprehensive assessment of GDF15 as a potential pharmacotherapy for the treatment of obesity.",
    "Gallbladder epithelium as a niche for chronic Salmonella carriage. Although typhoid fever has been intensively studied, chronic typhoid carriage still represents a problem for the transmission and persistence of the disease in areas of endemicity. This chronic state is highly associated with the presence of gallstones in the gallbladder of infected carriers upon which Salmonella can form robust biofilms. However, we hypothesize that in addition to gallstones, the gallbladder epithelium aids in the establishment/maintenance of chronic carriage. In this work, we present evidence of the role of the gallbladder epithelium in chronic carriage by a mechanism involving invasion, intracellular persistence, and biofilm formation. Salmonella was able to adhere to and invade polarized gallbladder epithelial cells apically in the absence and presence of bile in a Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1)-dependent manner. Intracellular replication of Salmonella was also evident at 12 and 24 h postinvasion. A flowthrough system revealed that Salmonella is able to adhere to and form extensive bacterial foci on gallbladder epithelial cells as early as 12 h postinoculation. In vivo experiments using a chronic mouse model of typhoid carriage showed invasion and damage of the gallbladder epithelium and lamina propria up to 2 months after Salmonella infection, with an abundant presence of macrophages, a relative absence of neutrophils, and extrusion of infected epithelial cells. Additionally, microcolonies of Salmonella cells were evident on the surface of the mouse gallbladder epithelia up to 21 days postinfection. These data reveal a second potential mechanism, intracellular persistence and/or bacterial aggregation in/on the gallbladder epithelium with luminal cell extrusion, for Salmonella maintenance in the gallbladder.",
    "Gangliosidoses. The gangliosidoses comprise a family of lysosomal storage diseases characterized by the accumulation of complex glycosphingolipids in the nervous system and other tissues, secondary to the deficient activity of lysosomal hydrolases or their associated activator proteins. GM1 and GM2 gangliosidosis are associated with deficiency of \u03b2-galactosidase and \u03b2-hexosaminidase respectively. All gangliosidoses are characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, the severity of which is proportional to the residual enzyme activity. The GM1 gangliosidoses are characterized by dysostosis, organomegaly and coarsening in their most severe forms, whereas children with classic infantile GM2 gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs disease) are usually spared systemic involvement, except in the case of the Sandhoff variant, in which organomegaly may occur. Cherry-red macular spots occur in the early onset forms of the gangliosidoses, but are less frequently seen in the less severe, later onset phenotypes. Macrocephaly, an exaggerated startle response, cognitive decline, seizures, ataxia, and progressive muscular atrophy may occur in different forms of gangliosidosis. The diagnosis is made by assay of enzyme activity, and can be confirmed by mutation analysis. Carrier screening for Tay-Sachs disease has been remarkably successful in reducing the incidence of this disease in the at-risk Ashkenazi population. There are no proven disease-modifying therapies for the gangliosidoses.",
    "Gas vesicle assembly in Microcyclus aquaticus. When observed in the electron microscope intact gas vesicles appeared as transparent areas in whole cells of Microcylus aquaticus, whereas vesicles collapsed by centrifugation were not discernible. Within 5 min of suspending cells containing collapsed vesicles in growth medium, small transparent vesicles were detected. By 15 min the average number of vesicles per cell was 15. This number remained relatively constant while the size of the vesicles increased until they attained their maximum diamtere of 100 nm. At this time the vesicles, interpreted as biconical structures, began to elongate presumably due to the synthesis of the cylindrical midsection. Closely correlated with the time at which vesicles began to elongate was the initiation of smaller vesicles which resulted in a doubling of the number of vesicles per cell by 90 min. This evidence coupled with the isolation of a mutant which assembles only the conical portions of the vesicle suggests that assembly occurs in two distinct stages subject to genetic mutation. Protein and ribonucleic acid synthesis, and presumably adenosine triphosphate formation, were required for gas vesicle assembly. In addition, inhibition of protein or ribonucleic acid synthesis resulted in a loss of extant gas vesicles. Over the time course of our study, deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis was not required for gas vesicle assembly or stability.",
    "Gender differences in Latin-American patients with rheumatoid arthritis. BACKGROUND: Data on the effect of gender in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in non-Caucasian populations is scarce. Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) is a large population with unique characteristics, including high admixture. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to examine the effect of gender in patients with RA in LAC. METHODS: This was a 2-phase study. First we conducted a cross-sectional and analytical study in which 1128 consecutive Colombian patients with RA were assessed. Second, a systematic review of the literature was done to evaluate the effect of gender in LAC patients with RA. RESULTS: Our results show a high prevalence of RA in LAC women with a ratio of 5.2 women per man. Colombian women with RA are more at risk of having an early age at onset and developing polyautoimmunity and abdominal obesity, and they perform more household duties than their male counterparts. However, male gender was associated with the presence of extra-articular manifestations. Of a total of 641 potentially relevant articles, 38 were considered for final analysis, in which several factors and outcomes related to gender were identified. CONCLUSIONS: RA in LAC women is not only more common but presents with some clinical characteristics that differ from RA presentation in men. Some of those characteristics could explain the high rates of disability and worse prognosis observed in women with RA in LAC.",
    "Generation of Oxtr cDNA(HA)-Ires-Cre Mice for Gene Expression in an Oxytocin Receptor Specific Manner. The neurohypophysial hormone oxytocin (OXT) and its receptor (OXTR) have critical roles in the regulation of pro-social behaviors, including social recognition, pair bonding, parental behavior, and stress-related responses. Supporting this hypothesis, a portion of patients suffering from autism spectrum disorder have mutations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, or epigenetic modifications in their OXTR gene. We previously reported that OXTR-deficient mice exhibit pervasive social deficits, indicating the critical role of OXTR in social behaviors. In the present study, we generated Oxtr cDNA(HA)-Ires-Cre knock-in mice, expressing both OXTR and Cre recombinase under the control of the endogenous Oxtr promoter. Knock-in cassette of Oxtr cDNA(HA)-Ires-Cre consisted of Oxtr cDNA tagged with the hemagglutinin epitope at the 3' end (Oxtr cDNA(HA)), internal ribosomal entry site (Ires), and Cre. Cre was expressed in the uterus, mammary gland, kidney, and brain of Oxtr cDNA(HA)-Ires-Cre knock-in mice. Furthermore, the distribution of Cre in the brain was similar to that observed in Oxtr-Venus fluorescent protein expressing mice (Oxtr-Venus), another animal model previously generated by our group. Social behavior of Oxtr cDNA(HA)-Ires-Cre knock-in mice was similar to that of wild-type animals. We demonstrated that this construct is expressed in OXTR-expressing neurons specifically after an infection with the recombinant adeno-associated virus carrying the flip-excision switch vector. Using this system, we showed the transport of the wheat-germ agglutinin tracing molecule from the OXTR-expressing neurons to the innervated neurons in knock-in mice. This study might contribute to the monosynaptic analysis of neuronal circuits and to the optogenetic analysis of neurons expressing OXTR.",
    "Genetics of pituitary adenomas. Pituitary adenomas are common tumors of the adenohypophysis which can cause considerable morbidity, due to excessive hormonal secretion or compression and local invasion of surrounding structures. The vast majority of pituitary adenomas occur sporadically. Altered gene expression is commonly detected but somatic mutations, epigenetic changes and abnormal microRNAs have also been described. Occurrence of GNAS mutations at a postzygotic stage lead to McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS), a disease causing endocrine hyperfunction and tumors in several organs, including the pituitary. Familial pituitary adenomas occur as part of a syndrome affecting other organs, such as in MEN1 or Carney complex, or occur with pituitary adenomas only as in familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA). FIPA, an autosomal-dominant disease with variable penetrance, is explained in 20% of patients by germline mutations in the tumor suppressor aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein(AIP), while no gene abnormality has been identified to date in the majority of the FIPA families. AIP mutation-positive patients have a characteristic clinical phenotype with usually young- or childhood-onset growth hormone (GH) and/or prolactin (PRL)-secreting adenomas and can be seen in cases with no apparent family history as well. Understanding the tumorigenic process in AIP-positive and AIP-negative FIPA patients could result in better diagnostic and treatment options for both familial and sporadic cases.",
    "Genetics of rheumatoid arthritis - a comprehensive review. The \"Bermuda triangle\" of genetics, environment and autoimmunity is involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Various aspects of genetic contribution to the etiology, pathogenesis and outcome of RA are discussed in this review. The heritability of RA has been estimated to be about 60 %, while the contribution of HLA to heritability has been estimated to be 11-37 %. Apart from known shared epitope (SE) alleles, such as HLA-DRB1*01 and DRB1*04, other HLA alleles, such as HLA-DRB1*13 and DRB1*15 have been linked to RA susceptibility. A novel SE classification divides SE alleles into S1, S2, S3P and S3D groups, where primarily S2 and S3P groups have been associated with predisposition to seropositive RA. The most relevant non-HLA gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with RA include PTPN22, IL23R, TRAF1, CTLA4, IRF5, STAT4, CCR6, PADI4. Large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 30 loci involved in RA pathogenesis. HLA and some non-HLA genes may differentiate between anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) seropositive and seronegative RA. Genetic susceptibility has also been associated with environmental factors, primarily smoking. Some GWAS studies carried out in rodent models of arthritis have confirmed the role of human genes. For example, in the collagen-induced (CIA) and proteoglycan-induced arthritis (PgIA) models, two important loci - Pgia26/Cia5 and Pgia2/Cia2/Cia3, corresponding the human PTPN22/CD2 and TRAF1/C5 loci, respectively - have been identified. Finally, pharmacogenomics identified SNPs or multiple genetic signatures that may be associated with responses to traditional disease-modifying drugs and biologics.",
    "Genomic context analysis reveals dense interaction network between vertebrate ultraconserved non-coding elements. MOTIVATION: Genomic context analysis, also known as phylogenetic profiling, is widely used to infer functional interactions between proteins but rarely applied to non-coding cis-regulatory DNA elements. We were wondering whether this approach could provide insights about utlraconserved non-coding elements (UCNEs). These elements are organized as large clusters, so-called gene regulatory blocks (GRBs) around key developmental genes. Their molecular functions and the reasons for their high degree of conservation remain enigmatic. RESULTS: In a special setting of genomic context analysis, we analyzed the fate of GRBs after a whole-genome duplication event in five fish genomes. We found that in most cases all UCNEs were retained together as a single block, whereas the corresponding target genes were often retained in two copies, one completely devoid of UCNEs. This 'winner-takes-all' pattern suggests that UCNEs of a GRB function in a highly cooperative manner. We propose that the multitude of interactions between UCNEs is the reason for their extreme sequence conservation.

    "Genomic organization of the human kallikrein gene family on chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4. Kallikreins are a subgroup of serine proteases with diverse physiological functions. Recently, growing evidence indicates that many kallikrein genes are involved in malignancy. In rodents, kallikreins are encoded by a large multigene family, but in humans only three kallikreins were thought to exist. Based on the homology between the human and rodent kallikrein loci, we studied a 300 kb region of genomic sequences around the putative KLK1 gene locus on chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4. By using linear sequence information, restriction analysis, end sequencing, PCR and blotting techniques, as well as bioinformatic approaches, we were able to construct the first detailed map of the human kallikrein gene family. Comparative analysis of genes located in this area, provides strong evidence that the human kallikrein gene family locus on chromosome 19 is considerably larger than previously thought, containing at least fifteen genes. We have established, for the first time, the common structural features that apply to all members of the expanded kallikrein multigene family. Our map specifies the distance between genes to one base pair accuracy, the relative location, and the direction of transcription of all 15 genes. Determination of the true size of the kallikrein family in humans is important for our understanding of the contribution of the kallikreins to human biology and pathophysiology.",
    "Genotype-phenotype correlations in nemaline myopathy caused by mutations in the genes for nebulin and skeletal muscle alpha-actin. We present comparisons of the clinical pictures in a series of 60 patients with nemaline myopathy in whom mutations had been identified in the genes for nebulin or skeletal muscle alpha-actin. In the patients with nebulin mutations, the typical form of nemaline myopathy predominated, while severe, mild or intermediate forms were less frequent. Autosomal recessive inheritance had been verified or appeared likely in all nebulin cases. In the patients with actin mutations, the severe form of nemaline myopathy was the most common, but some had the mild or typical form, and a few showed other associated features such as intranuclear rods or actin accumulation. Most cases were sporadic, but in addition there were instances of both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance, while two families showed mosaicism for dominant mutations. Although no specific phenotype was found to be associated with mutations in either gene, clinical and histological features together with pedigree data may be used in guiding mutation detection. Finding the causative mutation(s) determines the mode of inheritance and permits prenatal diagnosis if requested, but will not as such permit prognostication.",
    "Giant-cell tumor of bone: treatment options and role of denosumab. Giant-cell tumor of bone is a rare, locally aggressive tumor that typically occurs in the bones of skeletally mature young adults in their second to fourth decades. Traditionally, surgery has been the mainstay of therapy for this disease, but the disease can recur even with optimal procedures. Furthermore, it may occur in locations where a surgical approach would be morbid. The maturation of the understanding of the role of the receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) in the pathophysiology of giant-cell tumor of bone has led to the use of denosumab, a monoclonal antibody against RANKL, in this disease. In 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration approved denosumab for use in patients with recurrent/unresectable/metastatic giant-cell tumor of bone or for patients in whom surgery would be morbid.",
    "Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists for Type 2 Diabetes: A Clinical Update of Safety and Efficacy. INTRODUCTION: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are increasingly being used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, but consideration of benefits and potential adverse events is required. This review examines the state of glycemic control, weight loss, blood pressure, and tolerability, as well as the current debate about the safety of GLP-1 RAs, including risk of pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and thyroid cancer. METHODS: A MEDLINE search (2010-2015) identified publications that discussed longer-acting GLP-1 RAs. Search terms included GLP-1 receptor agonists, liraglutide, exenatide, lixisenatide, semaglutide, dulaglutide, albiglutide, efficacy, safety, pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and thyroid cancer. Abstracts from the American Diabetes Association, European Association for the Study of Diabetes, and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists from 2010 to 2015 were also searched. Efficacy and safety studies, pooled analyses, and meta-analyses were prioritized. RESULTS: Research has confirmed that GLP-1 RAs provide robust glycemic control, weight loss, and blood pressure re-duction. Current studies do not prove increased risk of pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, or thyroid cancer but more trials are needed since publications that indicate safety or suggest increased risk have methodological flaws that prevent firm conclusions to be drawn about these rare, long-term events. CONCLUSION: GLP-1 RA therapy in the context of individualized, patient-centered care continues to be supported by current literature. GLP-1 RA therapy provides robust glycemic control, blood pressure reduction, and weight loss, but studies are still needed to address concerns about tolerability and safety, including pancreatitis and cancer.",
    "Grg3, a murine Groucho-related gene, is expressed in the developing nervous system and in mesenchyme-induced epithelial structures. We have isolated cDNAs representing multiple members of murine groucho homologues, designated Grg for groucho-related genes. Among them, Grg3 appears to produce two transcripts. One of the Grg3 transcripts contains coding sequence for a complete Groucho protein homologue. The second transcript contains coding sequence for only the two amino-terminal domains of the Groucho protein, followed by a hydrophobic tail and a stop codon. We analyzed the expression of both transcripts in mouse embryos using RNase protection and in situ hybridization. Expression was detected during cell determination in the nervous system and in somitic mesoderm, overlapping Notch1 expression and adjacent to Mash1, MyoD and Myf5 expression. Thus, the expression pattern of Grg3 suggests a conserved role in the Notch signalling pathway to regulate expression of basic helix-loop-helix proteins and cell determination. Grg3 expression was also consistently detected in epithelial structures undergoing mesenchyme induction.",
    "Groucho-mediated repression may result from a histone deacetylase-dependent increase in nucleosome density. Groucho (Gro) is a Drosophila melanogaster transcriptional corepressor that directly interacts with the histone deacetylase Rpd3. Although previous studies suggest that this interaction is required for repression of Gro-responsive reporters in cultured cells, the in vivo significance of this interaction and the mechanism by which it leads to repression remain largely unexplored. In this study, we show that Gro is partially dependent on Rpd3 for repression, supporting the idea that Rpd3-mediated repression is one mode of Gro-mediated repression. We demonstrate that Gro colocalizes with Rpd3 to the chromatin of a target gene and that this is accompanied by the deacetylation of specific lysines within the N-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4. Gro overexpression leads to wing patterning defects and ectopic repression in the wing disc of transcription directed by the vestigial quadrant enhancer. These effects are reversed by the histone deacetylase inhibitors TSA and HC-Toxin and by the reduction of Rpd3 gene dosage. Furthermore, repression of the vestigial quadrant enhancer is accompanied by a Gro-mediated increase in nucleosome density, an effect that is reversed by histone deacetylase inhibitors. We propose a model in which Gro-mediated histone deacetylation results in increased nucleosome density leading to transcriptional repression.",
    "H2A histone-fold and DNA elements in nucleosome activate SWR1-mediated H2A.Z replacement in budding yeast. The histone variant H2A.Z is a universal mark of gene promoters, enhancers, and regulatory elements in eukaryotic chromatin. The chromatin remodeler SWR1 mediates site-specific incorporation of H2A.Z by a multi-step histone replacement reaction, evicting histone H2A-H2B from the canonical nucleosome and depositing the H2A.Z-H2B dimer. Binding of both substrates, the canonical nucleosome and the H2A.Z-H2B dimer, is essential for activation of SWR1. We found that SWR1 primarily recognizes key residues within the \u03b12 helix in the histone-fold of nucleosomal histone H2A, a region not previously known to influence remodeler activity. Moreover, SWR1 interacts preferentially with nucleosomal DNA at superhelix location 2 on the nucleosome face distal to its linker-binding site. Our findings provide new molecular insights on recognition of the canonical nucleosome by a chromatin remodeler and have implications for ATP-driven mechanisms of histone eviction and deposition.",
    "Heme and FLVCR-related transporter families SLC48 and SLC49. Heme is critical for a variety of cellular processes, but excess intracellular heme may result in oxidative stress and membrane injury. Feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor (FLVCR1), a member of the SLC49 family of four paralogous genes, is a cell surface heme exporter, essential for erythropoiesis and systemic iron homeostasis. Disruption of FLVCR1 function blocks development of erythroid progenitors, likely due to heme toxicity. Mutations of SLC49A1 encoding FLVCR1 are noted in patients with a rare neurodegenerative disorder: posterior column ataxia with retinitis pigmentosa. FLVCR2 is highly homologous to FLVCR1 and may function as a cellular heme importer. Mutations of SLC49A2 encoding FLVCR2 are observed in Fowler syndrome, a rare proliferative vascular disorder of the brain. The functions of the remaining members of the SLC49 family, MFSD7 and DIRC2 (encoded by the SLC49A3 and SLC49A4 genes), are unknown, although the latter is implicated in hereditary renal carcinomas. SLC48A1 (heme responsive gene-1, HRG-1), the sole member of the SLC48 family, is associated with the endosome and appears to transport heme from the endosome into the cytosol.",
    "Hemorheological alterations in sickle cell anemia and their clinical consequences - The role of genetic modulators. Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by the HBB:c.20A>T mutation that leads to hemoglobin S synthesis. The disease presents with high clinical heterogeneity characterized by chronic hemolysis, recurrent episodes of vaso-oclusion and infection. This work aimed to characterize by in silico studies some genetic modulators of severe hemolysis and stroke risk in children with SCA, and understand their consequences at the hemorheological level.Association studies were performed between hemolysis biomarkers as well as the degree of cerebral vasculopathy and the inheritance of several polymorphic regions in genes related with vascular cell adhesion and vascular tonus in pediatric SCA patients. In silico tools (e.g. MatInspector) were applied to investigate the main variant consequences.Variants in vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM1) gene promoter and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) gene were significantly associated with higher degree of hemolysis and stroke events. They potentially modify transcription factor binding sites (e.g. VCAM1 rs1409419_T allele may lead to an EVI1 gain) or disturb the corresponding protein structure/function. Our findings emphasize the relevance of genetic variation in modulating the disease severity due to their effect on gene expression or modification of protein biological activities related with sickled erythrocyte/endothelial interactions and consequent hemorheological abnormalities.",
    "Hereditary renal amyloidosis associated with a mutant fibrinogen alpha-chain. Three members of a family who died with renal amyloidosis were found to share a single nucleotide substitution in the fibrinogen alpha-chain gene. The predicted arginine to leucine mutation (Arg554Leu) was proven by amino acid sequence analysis of amyloid fibril protein isolated from postmortem kidney of an affected individual. Direct genomic DNA sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis demonstrated that all three affected individuals had the guanine to thymine 4993 transversion. This is the first demonstration of hereditary amyloidosis associated with a variant fibrinogen alpha-chain. Variants of circulating fibrinogen may be the cause of a number of systemic amyloidoses with primarily renal involvement.",
    "High specific detection and near-infrared photothermal therapy of lung cancer cells with high SERS active aptamer-silver-gold shell-core nanostructures. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Its early detection is of paramount importance for diagnosis, classification, treatment, and improvement of survivorship. However, current methods are not sensitive enough to detect lung cancer in its nascent stage. We reported an aptamer-Ag-Au shell-core nanostructure-based surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) assay for sensitive and specific detection, and near-infrared (NIR) photothermal therapy of lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549 cells). The nanostructures target the cells with high affinity and specificity via the specific interaction between the aptamer (a 45-base oligonucleotide) and the cell, and distinguish A549 cells from other types of cancer cells (HeLa and MCF-7 cells) and subtypes of lung cancer cells (NCI-H157, NCI-H520, NCI-H1299, and NCI-H446 cells). The nanostructures have a high capability to absorb NIR irradiation and are able to perform photothermal therapy of the cells at a very low irradiation power density (0.20 W cm(-2)) without destroying the healthy cells and the surrounding normal tissues. In addition, the nanostructures exhibit a high SERS activity. Based on the SERS signal of the labeled Raman reporter (Rh6G molecules), we can specifically detect A549 cells at a very low abundance (~10 cells per mL) and monitor the therapy process of the cancer cells. Therefore, this nanostructure-based SERS assay has great potential in specific recognition, sensitive detection, and effective photothermal therapy of lung cancer.",
    "Histone modifications and lamin A regulate chromatin protein dynamics in early embryonic stem cell differentiation. Embryonic stem cells are characterized by unique epigenetic features including decondensed chromatin and hyperdynamic association of chromatin proteins with chromatin. Here we investigate the potential mechanisms that regulate chromatin plasticity in embryonic stem cells. Using epigenetic drugs and mutant embryonic stem cells lacking various chromatin proteins, we find that histone acetylation, G9a-mediated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation and lamin A expression, all affect chromatin protein dynamics. Histone acetylation controls, almost exclusively, euchromatin protein dynamics; lamin A expression regulates heterochromatin protein dynamics, and G9a regulates both euchromatin and heterochromatin protein dynamics. In contrast, we find that DNA methylation and nucleosome repeat length have little or no effect on chromatin-binding protein dynamics in embryonic stem cells. Altered chromatin dynamics associates with perturbed embryonic stem cell differentiation. Together, these data provide mechanistic insights into the epigenetic pathways that are responsible for chromatin plasticity in embryonic stem cells, and indicate that the genome's epigenetic state modulates chromatin plasticity and differentiation potential of embryonic stem cells.",
    "Homozygous mutations in LPIN2 are responsible for the syndrome of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis and congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia (Majeed syndrome). BACKGROUND: Majeed syndrome is an autosomal recessive, autoinflammatory disorder characterised by chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis and congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia. The objectives of this study were to map, identify, and characterise the Majeed syndrome causal gene and to speculate on its function and role in skin and bone inflammation. METHODS: Six individuals with Majeed syndrome from two unrelated families were identified for this study. Homozygosity mapping and parametric linkage analysis were employed for the localisation of the gene responsible for Majeed syndrome. Direct sequencing was utilised for the identification of mutations within the genes contained in the region of linkage. Expression studies and in silico characterisation of the identified causal gene and its protein were carried out. RESULTS: The phenotype of Majeed syndrome includes inflammation of the bone and skin, recurrent fevers, and dyserythropoietic anaemia. The clinical picture of the six affected individuals is briefly reviewed. The gene was mapped to a 5.5 cM interval (1.8 Mb) on chromosome 18p. Examination of genes in this interval led to the identification of homozygous mutations in LPIN2 in affected individuals from the two families. LPIN2 was found to be expressed in almost all tissues. The function of LPIN2 and its role in inflammation remains unknown. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that homozygous mutations in LPIN2 result in Majeed syndrome. Understanding the aberrant immune response in this condition will shed light on the aetiology of other inflammatory disorders of multifactorial aetiology including isolated chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, Sweet syndrome, and psoriasis.",
    "Hormonal and systemic regulation of sclerostin. The Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway plays an essential role in osteoblast biology. Sclerostin is a soluble antagonist of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling secreted primarily by osteocytes. Current evidence indicates that sclerostin likely functions as a local/paracrine regulator of bone metabolism rather than as an endocrine hormone. Nonetheless, circulating sclerostin levels in humans often reflect changes in the bone microenvironment, although there may be exceptions to this observation. Using existing assays, circulating sclerostin levels have been shown to be altered in response to both hormonal stimuli and across a variety of normal physiological and pathophysiological conditions. In both rodents and humans, parathyroid hormone provided either intermittently or continuously suppresses sclerostin levels. Likewise, most evidence from both human and animal studies supports a suppressive effect of estrogen on sclerostin levels. Efforts to examine non-hormonal/systemic regulation of sclerostin have in general shown less consistent findings or have provided associations rather than direct interventional information, with the exception of mechanosensory studies which have consistently demonstrated increased sclerostin levels with skeletal unloading, and conversely decreases in sclerostin with enhanced skeletal loading. Herein, we will review the existent literature on both hormonal and non-hormonal/systemic factors which have been studied for their impact on sclerostin regulation.",
    "Host factors are more important in predicting recurrent Clostridium difficile infection than ribotype and use of antibiotics. OBJECTIVE: A frequent complication of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is recurrent disease. The aim of this study was to determine whether early recurrence risk was higher after infection with ribotype 027 (outbreak strain) compared with infection with endemic strain types of C.\u00a0difficile. METHODS: Consecutive patients diagnosed with CDI between May 2013 and March 2014 were included (outbreak strain, and non-outbreak strains). Patients who developed recurrent CDI within 30\u00a0days after completion of CDI treatment, were compared with patients without a recurrence. Medical charts were reviewed for demographic and clinical characteristics. General practitioners were contacted to complete data about the occurrence of recurrent CDI, and the use of medication after hospital discharge. RESULTS: In total, 135 patients were at risk for the development of recurrent CDI; 74 patients were infected by ribotype 027, and 61 patients by other ribotypes. Thirty-nine patients (29%) developed recurrent CDI within 30\u00a0days after completion of CDI treatment. In multivariable analysis, age > 70\u00a0years (HR 3.05, 95% CI 1.54-6.03), and a duration of CDI treatment > 11\u00a0days (HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.00-3.69) were clearly associated with recurrence; infection with ribotype 027 showed a HR of 1.72 (95% CI 0.88-3.33). CONCLUSION: During this outbreak of C.\u00a0difficile in a tertiary care centre, age and a prolonged duration of CDI therapy (which is most likely a marker of underlying disease severity) were the main risk factors for recurrent CDI. This points to host factors as more important predictors for recurrent CDI than strain type or antibiotic use.",
    "Host-preferential Fusarium graminearum gene expression during infection of wheat, barley, and maize. Fusarium graminearum is a broad host pathogen threatening cereal crops in temperate regions around the world. To better understand how F. graminearum adapts to different hosts, we have performed a comparison of the transcriptome of a single strain of F. graminearum during early infection (up to 4 d post-inoculation) of barley, maize, and wheat using custom oligomer microarrays. Our results showed high similarity between F. graminearum transcriptomes in infected wheat and barley spike tissues. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to validate the gene expression profiles of 24 genes. Host-specific expression of genes was observed in each of the three hosts. This included expression of distinct sets of genes associated with transport and secondary metabolism in each of the three crops, as well as host-specific patterns for particular gene categories such as sugar transporters, integral membrane protein PTH11-like proteins, and chitinases. This study identified 69 F. graminearum genes as preferentially expressed in developing maize kernels relative to wheat and barley spikes. These host-specific differences showcase the genomic flexibility of F. graminearum to adapt to a range of hosts.",
    "How to use \u2026 the Monospot and other heterophile antibody tests. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a highly prevalent virus, transmitted via saliva, which often causes asymptomatic infection in children but frequently results in infectious mononucleosis in adolescents. Heterophile antibody tests, including the Monospot test, are red cell or latex agglutination assays, which detect antired cell antibodies produced as part of a polyclonal antibody response occurring during EBV infection. Heterophile antibody tests are rapid, cheap and specific tests that can be performed from the onset of symptoms of infectious mononucleosis. In adolescents, heterophile antibody tests have high specificity and sensitivity in the diagnosis of primary acute EBV infection. However, the tests have low sensitivity and low negative predictive value in young children and are not useful under the age of 4. Heterophile tests may be positive in other viral infections, autoimmune disease and haematological malignancies, but do not appear to be positive in primary bacterial infection. Virus-specific serology is required in children under the age of 4 or if an older child is heterophile negative. Virus-specific serology allows diagnosis and the pattern of positivity and negativity enables the clinician to stage the EBV infection. Virus-specific serology appears to have better sensitivity in young children, but there is cross-reaction with other herpesvirus infections, a longer turnaround time and it is more expensive to perform. Further research is needed to establish which children benefit from and hence require testing for heterophile antibodies, the cost-effectiveness of EBV investigations and whether heterophile titres have predictive value for the severity of infection and the likelihood of complications.",
    "Hsp90 is involved in the formation of P-bodies and stress granules. Previously, we found that treatment of cells with the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin (GA) leads to a substantial reduction in the number of processing bodies (P-bodies), and also alters the size and subcellular localization of stress granules. These findings imply that the chaperone activity of Hsp90 is involved in the formation of P-bodies and stress granules. To verify these observations, we examined whether another Hsp90 inhibitor radicicol (RA) affected P-bodies and stress granules. Treatment with RA reduced the level of the Hsp90 client protein Argonaute 2 and the number of P-bodies. Although stress granules still assembled in RA-treated cells upon heat shock, they were smaller and more dispersed in the cytoplasm than those in untreated cells. Furthermore eIF4E and eIF4E-transporter were dissociated selectively from stress granules in RA-treated cells. These observations were comparable to those obtained upon treatment with GA in our previous work. Thus, we conclude that abrogation of the chaperone activity of Hsp90 affects P-body formation and the integrity of stress granules.",
    "Human caspases: activation, specificity, and regulation. Caspases are intracellular proteases that propagate programmed cell death, proliferation, and inflammation. Activation of caspases occurs by a conserved mechanism subject to strict cellular regulation. Once activated by a specific stimulus, caspases execute limited proteolysis of downstream substrates to trigger a cascade of events that culminates in the desired biological response. Much has been learned of the mechanisms that govern the activation and regulation of caspases, and this minireview provides an update of these areas. We also delineate substantial gaps in knowledge of caspase function, which can be approached by techniques and experimental paradigms that are currently undergoing development.",
    "Human monoamine oxidase gene (MAOA): chromosome position (Xp21-p11) and DNA polymorphism. An essentially full-length cDNA clone for the human enzyme monoamine oxidase type A (MAO-A) has been used to determine the chromosomal location of a gene encoding it. This enzyme is important in the degradative metabolism of biogenic amines throughout the body and is located in the outer mitochondrial membrane of many cell types. Southern blot analysis of PstI-digested human DNA revealed multiple fragments that hybridized to this probe. Using rodent-human somatic cell hybrids containing all or part of the human X chromosome, we have mapped these fragments to the region Xp21-p11. A restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) for this MAOA gene was identified and used to evaluate linkage distances between this locus and several other loci on Xp. The MAOA locus lies between DXS14 and OTC, about 29 cM from the former.",
    "Hungarian Isradipine Study (HIS): long-term (3-year) effects on blood pressure and plasma lipids. These are the preliminary data of an open multicenter trial of antihypertensive treatment with isradipine as monotherapy (dose, 4.55 +/- 0.56 mg twice daily; n = 11) or isradipine (7.5 +/- 0.63 mg twice daily) in combination with bopindolol (1.16 +/- 0.12 mg once daily; n = 30) administered for 3 years to patients with essential hypertension (WHO classification I or II). Blood pressure was significantly decreased in both treatment groups and there was no indication of resistance to therapy. Plasma levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides were decreased by the end of the second year of treatment, and there was a tendency toward increase in plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL2 or HDL3). The atherogenic index (ratio between total cholesterol and HDL2 plus HDL3) was also decreased. Blood glucose levels remained unchanged in both normoglycemic patients and those with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) during 3 years of therapy. It is concluded that isradipine is safe and effective when administered long-term in the treatment of hypertensive patients with either hyperlipidemia or NIDDM.",
    "Hypermethylation of the CpG dinucleotide in epidermal growth factor receptor codon 790: implications for a mutational hotspot leading to the T790M mutation in non-small-cell lung cancer. Nearly one half of all cases of acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are due to the T790M mutation in EGFR exon 20. The T790M mutation is a C\u2192T transition mutation at a CpG dinucleotide. DNA methylation of cytosine (5-methylcytosine (5-mC)) in CpG dinucleotides is a common DNA modification; CpG dinucleotides are considered to be mutational hotspots that cause genetic diseases and cancers through spontaneous deamination of 5-mC, resulting in C\u2192T transition mutations. This study aimed to examine the methylation level of cytosine of EGFR codon 790 and investigate whether DNA methylation was involved in acquiring the T790M mutation. We examined 18 NSCLC tumor tissues, 7 normal lymph node tissues, and 4 NSCLC cell lines (PC9, HCC827, 11-18, and A549). 5-mC was checked by bisulfite sequencing and quantified by pyrosequencing. We found that all tissue samples and cell lines had 5-mC in EGFR codon 790. The 5-mC range was 58.4-90.8%. Our results imply that hypermethylation of the CpG dinucleotide in EGFR codon 790 leads to the C\u2192T transition mutation, causing resistance to EGFR-TKI treatment.",
    "Hypochondroplasia due to FGFR3 gene mutation (N540K) and mosaic form of Down syndrome in the same patient. The simultaneous presence of Down syndrome and achondroplasia has rarely been reported in the literature, and our search revealed only six patients with such an association. We are reporting the first case of a patient with Down syndrome and hypochondroplasia. In this patient, Down syndrome was clinically recognised and confirmed by the cytogenetic finding of mosaic karyotype (47,XX,+21/46,XX) shortly after birth. She was subsequently diagnosed with hypochondroplasia at the age of 6 years when disproportional short stature, stocky habitus and macrocephaly were observed. These phenotypic findings were later confirmed by the presence of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene mutation N540K. The overlapping common clinical features of Down syndrome and hypochondroplasia resulted in delayed diagnosis of hypochondroplasia in our patient and the associated deleterious effect on her linear growth. Her final height is 126.5 cm, which is -3.76 standard deviations (SD) lower than the median height in patients with Down syndrome, and is under the lower borderline of the adult height range for women with hypochondroplasia.",
    "IL-18 binding and inhibition of interferon gamma induction by human poxvirus-encoded proteins. Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) is a common, human poxvirus that causes small papular skin lesions that persist for long periods without signs of inflammation. Previous studies revealed that MCV encodes a family of proteins with homology to mammalian IL-18 binding proteins. IL-18 is a proinflammatory cytokine that induces synthesis of interferon gamma, activates NK cells, and is required for a T-lymphocyte helper type 1 response. We expressed and purified the proteins encoded by the MC53L and MC54L genes of MCV, as well as their human and murine homologs. All four recombinant proteins were able to bind with high affinity to human and murine IL-18 molecules and inhibited IL-18 mediated interferon gamma production in a dose-dependent manner. The pirating of IL-18 binding proteins by poxviruses and their use as decoy receptors is consistent with the critical role of IL-18 in defense against virus infections and provides a mechanism for evasion of the immune system by MCV.",

    "Idarucizumab Improves Outcome in Murine Brain Hemorrhage Related to Dabigatran. Lack of specific antidotes is a major concern in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) related to direct anticoagulants including dabigatran (OAC-ICH). We examined the efficacy of idarucizumab, an antibody fragment binding to dabigatran, in a mouse model of OAC-ICH. Dabigatran etexilate (DE) dose-dependently prolonged diluted thrombin time and tail-vein bleeding time, which were reversed by idarucizumab. Pretreatment with DE increased intracerebral hematoma volume and cerebral hemoglobin content. Idarucizumab in equimolar dose prevented excess hematoma expansion for both DE doses. In more extensive ICH, idarucizumab significantly reduced mortality. Thus, idarucizumab prevents excess intracerebral hematoma formation in mice anticoagulated with dabigatran and reduces mortality.",
    "Identification and characterization of polyadenylation signal (PAS) variants in human genomic sequences based on modified EST clustering. A large-scale analysis of human polyadenylation signals was carried out in silico. The most canonical AAUAAA hexamer and its 11 single-nucleotide variants that are most frequent in human genes were used to search for polyadenylation signals in the terminal sequences. Out of 18,277 poly(A) sites that were identified from 26,414 human genes, 82.5% of the sites were found to contain at least one of these 12 hexamers as a polyadenylation signal within 40 nucleotides upstream of the poly(A) site. The rest (17.5%) did not contain any of these hexamers, which suggests the existence of yet unknown signals. A total of 20,347 terminal sequences in close proximity to 12 polyadenylation signals were collected using modified EST clustering technique to establish a large-scale database of polyadenylation signals. To characterize the 12 hexamers, the locations of polyadenylation signals that were identified as \"authentic\" and the uracil contents of the downstream region of the signal were examined. Based on this analysis, the 11 variants of the canonical AAUAAA were identified as possibly forming \"functional\" signals as AAUAAA. Moreover, the observed frequency of 41.9% for AAUAAA was significantly lower than those of other reports, suggesting that the non-canonical variants are more important in the polyadenylation process than frequently recognized. Since the poly(A) sites processed by those non-canonical variants have not been generally annotated in major gene databases, it is important to determine whether the variant hexamers could work as polyadenylation signals that may be responsible for generating heterogeneity of mRNAs by alternative polyadenylation.",
    "Identification and functional analysis of a novel CaSR mutation in a family with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that plays an essential role in maintaining calcium homeostasis. In the present study, we analyzed the CaSR gene in a Korean family with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH). Genetic studies were performed by direct sequence analysis of the CaSR gene in genomic DNA obtained from peripheral leukocytes. A novel heterozygous G to T substitution at nucleotide position 1711 in exon 6, resulting in the G571W mutation, was identified in the CaSR gene in a 26-year-old female with asymptomatic hypercalcemia, a low calcium/creatinine clearance ratio, and normal intact parathyroid hormone. To study CaSR expression, the mutation was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into a wild-type (WT) CaSR-expressing pCR3.1 vector, and COS-7 cells were transfected with either the WT or mutant CaSR-containing vector. Transfected cells loaded with Fura-2/AM, a fluorescent indicator of Ca, were assessed for CaSR function by the change in intracellular calcium [as measured by the 340\u00a0nm/380\u00a0nm fluorescence intensity ratio (F340/F380)] made in response to challenge with extracellular Ca. Both WT and G571W cells had equivalent amounts of CaSR protein in the cell membrane. However, after challenge with extracellular Ca, cells transfected with G571W CaSR responded with a lower F340/F380 ratio than those transfected with WT CaSR and showed decreased sensitivity to extracellular Ca concentrations. The G571W mutation had therefore impaired the CaSR function. In conclusion, we identified a novel loss-of-function mutation, G571W, in the CaSR gene in a Korean family with FHH.",
    "Identification by in silico and in vitro screenings of small organic molecules acting as reversible inhibitors of kallikreins. Netherton syndrome is caused by loss-of-function mutations in SPINK5 encoding the Kazal-type inhibitor LEKTI-1 leading to dysregulation of proteolytic cascades involving several kallikreins. We used both structure-based and ligand-based virtual screening computations to identify commercially available non-covalent inhibitors of human kallikrein 5 (hK5), a serine protease (trypsin-like) that plays a central role in the initiation of the molecular cascades leading to the Netherton syndrome phenotype. The efficacy and mechanism of inhibition of the identified new families of organic compounds were analyzed not only for hK5 but also on other proteases implicated in the cascades (hK7, hK14 and matriptase). These inhibitors are nontoxic on healthy human keratinocytes and are structurally different from traditional serine protease inhibitors validating their potential utility as initial hits to control proteolytic disorders observed in dermatological pathologies such as Netherton syndrome.",
    "Identification of Biomarkers Associated With Alzheimer's Disease by Bioinformatics Analysis. BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: The microarray data of GSE16759 were from the expression profile samples of 4 parietal lobe tissues from patients with AD and 4 ones from age-matched control participants. The differentially expressed micro RNAs (miRNAs) and genes (DEGs) underwent hierarchical clustering and function analysis followed by target genes prediction. Finally, DEGs were mapped to the target genes to construct miRNA-regulated networks. RESULTS: A total of 427 DEGs were obtained and clustered into 5 functions. After DEGs were mapped to the predicted target genes, 313 regulatory pairs were established. The target genes SEC22 vesicle trafficking protein homolog B (SEC22B) and SEC63 homolog (SEC63) regulated by miRNA-206, RAB10, member RAS oncogene family (RAB10) regulated by miRNA-655, and fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT1) regulated by miRNA-30e-3p and miRNA-369-3p were involved in the biological processes of protein transport and regulation of cell motion. CONCLUSION: The target genes SEC22B, RAB10, and FLT1 may be potential biomarkers of AD.",
    "Identification of a heteromeric complex that promotes DNA replication origin firing in human cells. Treslin/TICRR (TopBP1-interacting, replication stimulating protein/TopBP1-interacting, checkpoint, and replication regulator), the human ortholog of the yeast Sld3 protein, is an essential DNA replication factor that is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases and the DNA damage checkpoint. We identified MDM two binding protein (MTBP) as a factor that interacts with Treslin/TICRR throughout the cell cycle. We show that MTBP depletion by means of small interfering RNA inhibits DNA replication by preventing assembly of the CMG (Cdc45-MCM-GINS) holohelicase during origin firing. Although MTBP has been implicated in the function of the p53 tumor suppressor, we found MTBP is required for DNA replication irrespective of a cell's p53 status. We propose that MTBP acts with Treslin/TICRR to integrate signals from cell cycle and DNA damage response pathways to control the initiation of DNA replication in human cells.",
    "Identification of recombinant alleles using quantitative real-time PCR implications for Gaucher disease. Pseudogenes, resulting from duplications of functional genes, contribute to the functional complexity of their parental genes. The glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA), located in a gene-rich region on chromosome 1q 21, is mutated in Gaucher disease. The presence of contiguous, highly homologous pseudogenes for both GBA and metaxin 1 at this locus increases the likelihood of DNA rearrangement. We describe a facile method to identify and analyze recombinant alleles in patients with Gaucher disease. Genomic DNA from 20 patients with recombinant GBA alleles and five controls was evaluated to identify DNA rearrangements or copy number variation using six probes specific for either the GBA gene or pseudogene. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on genomic DNA, and Southern blot analyses using HincII together with sequencing confirmed the real-time results. Both GBA fusions and duplications could be detected. Different sites of crossover were identified, and alleles resulting from gene conversion could be distinguished from reciprocal recombinant alleles. Quantitative real-time PCR is a sensitive and rapid method to detect fusions and duplications in patients with recombinant GBA alleles. This technique is more sensitive, faster, and cheaper than Southern blot analysis, and can be used in diagnostic laboratories, and to detect other recombinant alleles within the genome.",
    "Identifying the genomic regions and regulatory factors that control the transcription of genes is an important, unsolved problem. The current method of choice predicts transcription factor (TF) binding sites using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq), and then links the binding sites to putative target genes solely on the basis of the genomic distance between them. Evidence from chromatin conformation capture experiments shows that this approach is inadequate due to long-distance regulation via chromatin looping. We present CisMapper, which predicts the regulatory targets of a TF using the correlation between a histone mark at the TF's bound sites and the expression of each gene across a panel of tissues. Using both chromatin conformation capture and differential expression data, we show that CisMapper is more accurate at predicting the target genes of a TF than the distance-based approaches currently used, and is particularly advantageous for predicting the long-range regulatory interactions typical of tissue-specific gene expression. CisMapper also predicts which TF binding sites regulate a given gene more accurately than using genomic distance. Unlike distance-based methods, CisMapper can predict which transcription start site of a gene is regulated by a particular binding site of the TF. CisMapper: predicting regulatory interactions from transcription factor ChIP-seq data.",
    "Imaging of plantar fascia disorders: findings on plain radiography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Plantar fascia (PF) disorders commonly cause heel pain and disability in the general population. Imaging is often required to confirm diagnosis. This review article aims to provide simple and systematic guidelines for imaging assessment of PF disease, focussing on key findings detectable on plain radiography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Sonographic characteristics of plantar fasciitis include PF thickening, loss of fibrillar structure, perifascial collections, calcifications and hyperaemia on Doppler imaging. Thickening and signal changes in the PF as well as oedema of adjacent soft tissues and bone marrow can be assessed on MRI. Radiographic findings of plantar fasciitis include PF thickening, cortical irregularities and abnormalities in the fat pad located deep below the PF. Plantar fibromatosis appears as well-demarcated, nodular thickenings that are iso-hypoechoic on ultrasound and show low-signal intensity on MRI. PF tears present with partial or complete fibre interruption on both ultrasound and MRI. Imaging description of further PF disorders, including xanthoma, diabetic fascial disease, foreign-body reactions and plantar infections, is detailed in the main text. Ultrasound and MRI should be considered as first- and second-line modalities for assessment of PF disorders, respectively. Indirect findings of PF disease can be ruled out on plain radiography. Teaching Points \u2022 PF disorders commonly cause heel pain and disability in the general population.\u2022 Imaging is often required to confirm diagnosis or reveal concomitant injuries.\u2022 Ultrasound and MRI respectively represent the first- and second-line modalities for diagnosis.\u2022 Indirect findings of PF disease can be ruled out on plain radiography.",
    "Immunoaffinity enrichment and mass spectrometry analysis of protein methylation. Protein methylation is a common posttranslational modification that mostly occurs on arginine and lysine residues. Arginine methylation has been reported to regulate RNA processing, gene transcription, DNA damage repair, protein translocation, and signal transduction. Lysine methylation is best known to regulate histone function and is involved in epigenetic regulation of gene transcription. To better study protein methylation, we have developed highly specific antibodies against monomethyl arginine; asymmetric dimethyl arginine; and monomethyl, dimethyl, and trimethyl lysine motifs. These antibodies were used to perform immunoaffinity purification of methyl peptides followed by LC-MS/MS analysis to identify and quantify arginine and lysine methylation sites in several model studies. Overall, we identified over 1000 arginine methylation sites in human cell line and mouse tissues, and \u223c160 lysine methylation sites in human cell line HCT116. The number of methylation sites identified in this study exceeds those found in the literature to date. Detailed analysis of arginine-methylated proteins observed in mouse brain compared with those found in mouse embryo shows a tissue-specific distribution of arginine methylation, and extends the types of proteins that are known to be arginine methylated to include many new protein types. Many arginine-methylated proteins that we identified from the brain, including receptors, ion channels, transporters, and vesicle proteins, are involved in synaptic transmission, whereas the most abundant methylated proteins identified from mouse embryo are transcriptional regulators and RNA processing proteins.",
    "Immunogenicity and safety of the candidate RTS,S/AS01 vaccine in young Nigerian children: a randomized, double-blind, lot-to-lot consistency trial. BACKGROUND: For regulatory approval, consistency in manufacturing of vaccine lots is expected to be demonstrated in confirmatory immunogenicity studies using two-sided equivalence trials. This randomized, double-blind study (NCT01323972) assessed consistency of three RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine batches formulated from commercial-scale purified antigen bulk lots in terms of anti-CS-responses induced. METHODS: Healthy children aged 5-17 months were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive RTS,S/AS01 at 0-1-2 months from one of three commercial-scale purified antigen bulk lots (1600 litres-fermentation scale; commercial-scale lots), or a comparator vaccine batch made from pilot-scale purified antigen bulk lot (20 litres-fermentation scale; pilot-scale lot). The co-primary objectives were to first demonstrate consistency of antibody responses against circumsporozoite (CS) protein at one month post-dose 3 for the three commercial-scale lots and second demonstrate non-inferiority of anti-CS antibody responses at one month post-dose 3 for the commercial-scale lots compared to the pilot-scale lot. Safety and reactogenicity were evaluated as secondary endpoints. RESULTS: One month post-dose-3, anti-CS antibody geometric mean titres (GMT) for the 3 commercial scale lots were 319.6 EU/ml (95% confidence interval (CI): 268.9-379.8), 241.4 EU/ml (207.6-280.7), and 302.3 EU/ml (259.4-352.3). Consistency for the RTS,S/AS01 commercial-scale lots was demonstrated as the two-sided 95% CI of the anti-CS antibody GMT ratio between each pair of lots was within the range of 0.5-2.0. GMT of the pooled commercial-scale lots (285.8 EU/ml (260.7-313.3)) was non-inferior to the pilot-scale lot (271.7 EU/ml (228.5-323.1)). Each RTS,S/AS01 lot had an acceptable tolerability profile, with infrequent reports of grade 3 solicited symptoms. No safety signals were identified and no serious adverse events were considered related to vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: RTS,S/AS01 lots formulated from commercial-scale purified antigen bulk batches induced a consistent anti-CS antibody response, and the anti-CS GMT of pooled commercial-scale lots was non-inferior to that of a lot formulated from a pilot-scale antigen bulk batch.",
    "Impact of training for healthcare professionals on how to manage an opioid overdose with naloxone: effective, but dissemination is challenging. BACKGROUND: Opioid overdose has a high mortality, but is often reversible with appropriate overdose management and naloxone (opioid antagonist). Training in these skills has been successfully trialled internationally with opioid users themselves. Healthcare professionals working in substance misuse are in a prime position to deliver overdose prevention training to drug users and may themselves witness opioid overdoses. The best method of training dissemination has not been identified. The study assessed post-training change in clinician knowledge for managing an opioid overdose and administering naloxone, evaluated the 'cascade method' for disseminating training, and identified barriers to implementation. METHODS: A repeated-measures design evaluated knowledge pre-and-post training. A sub-set of clinicians were interviewed to identify barriers to implementation. Clinicians from addiction services across England received training. Participants self-completed a structured questionnaire recording overdose knowledge, confidence and barriers to implementation. RESULTS: One hundred clinicians were trained initially, who trained a further 119 clinicians (n=219) and thereafter trained 239 drug users. The mean composite score for opioid overdose risk signs and actions to be taken was 18.3/26 (\u00b13.8) which increased to 21.2/26 (\u00b14.1) after training, demonstrating a significant improvement in knowledge (Z=9.2, p<0.001). The proportion of clinicians willing to use naloxone in an opioid overdose rose from 77% to 99% after training. Barriers to implementing training were clinician time and confidence, service resources, client willingness and naloxone formulation. CONCLUSIONS: Training clinicians how to manage an opioid overdose and administer naloxone was effective. However the 'cascade method' was only modestly successful for disseminating training to a large clinician workforce, with a range of clinician and service perceived obstacles. Drug policy changes and improvements to educational programmes for drug services would be important to ensure successful implementation of overdose training internationally.",
    "Implications of the human microbiome in inflammatory bowel diseases. The study of the human microbiome or community of microorganisms and collection of genomes found in the human body is one of the fastest growing research areas because many diseases are reported to be associated with microbiome imbalance or dysbiosis. With the improvement in novel sequencing techniques, researchers are now generating millions of sequences of different sites from the human body and evaluating specific differences in microbial communities. The importance of microbiome constituency is so relevant that several consortia like the Human Microbiome project (HMP) and Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract (MetaHIT) project are focusing mainly on the human microbiome. The aim of this review is to highlight points of research in this field, mainly focusing on particular factors that modulate the microbiome and important insights into its potential impact on our health and well-being.",
    "In vivo anti-tumor activity of the PARP inhibitor niraparib in homologous recombination deficient and proficient ovarian carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have yielded encouraging responses in high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOCs), but the optimal treatment setting remains unknown. We assessed the effect of niraparib on HGSOC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models as well as the relationship between certain markers of homologous recombination (HR) status, including BRCA1/2 mutations and formation of RAD51 foci after DNA damage, and response of these PDXs to niraparib in vivo. METHODS: Massively parallel sequencing was performed on HGSOCs to identify mutations contributing to HR deficiency. HR pathway integrity was assessed using fluorescence microscopy-based RAD51 focus formation assays. Effects of niraparib (MK-4827) on treatment-na\u00efve PDX tumor growth as monotherapy, in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel, and as maintenance therapy were assessed by transabdominal ultrasound. Niraparib responses were correlated with changes in levels of poly(ADP-ribose), PARP1, and repair proteins by western blotting. RESULTS: Five PDX models were evaluated in vivo. Tumor regressions were induced by single-agent niraparib in one of two PDX models with deleterious BRCA2 mutations and in a PDX with RAD51C promoter methylation. Diminished formation of RAD51 foci failed to predict response, but Artemis loss was associated with resistance. Niraparib generally failed to enhance responses to carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy, but maintenance niraparib therapy delayed progression in a BRCA2-deficient PDX. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in HR genes are neither necessary nor sufficient to predict response to niraparib. Assessment of repair status through multiple complementary assays is needed to guide PARP inhibitor therapy, design future clinical trials and identify ovarian cancer patients most likely to benefit from PARP inhibition.",
    "In vivo quantification of calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor occupancy by telcagepant in rhesus monkey and human brain using the positron emission tomography tracer [11C]MK-4232. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a potent neuropeptide whose agonist interaction with the CGRP receptor (CGRP-R) in the periphery promotes vasodilation, neurogenic inflammation and trigeminovascular sensory activation. This process is implicated in the cause of migraine headaches, and CGRP-R antagonists in clinical development have proven effective in treating migraine-related pain in humans. CGRP-R is expressed on blood vessel smooth muscle and sensory trigeminal neurons and fibers in the periphery as well as in the central nervous system. However, it is not clear what role the inhibition of central CGRP-R plays in migraine pain relief. To this end, the CGRP-R positron emission tomography (PET) tracer [(11)C]MK-4232 (2-[(8R)-8-(3,5-difluorophenyl)-6,8-[6-(11)C]dimethyl-10-oxo-6,9-diazaspiro[4.5]decan-9-yl]-N-[(2R)-2'-oxospiro[1,3-dihydroindene-2,3'-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine]-5-yl]acetamide) was discovered and developed for use in clinical PET studies. In rhesus monkeys and humans, [(11)C]MK-4232 displayed rapid brain uptake and a regional brain distribution consistent with the known distribution of CGRP-R. Monkey PET studies with [(11)C]MK-4232 after intravenous dosing with CGRP-R antagonists validated the ability of [(11)C]MK-4232 to detect changes in CGRP-R occupancy in proportion to drug plasma concentration. Application of [(11)C]MK-4232 in human PET studies revealed that telcagepant achieved only low receptor occupancy at an efficacious dose (140 mg PO). Therefore, it is unlikely that antagonism of central CGRP-R is required for migraine efficacy. However, it is not known whether high central CGRP-R antagonism may provide additional therapeutic benefit.",
    "Increased NLRP3-dependent interleukin 1\u03b2 secretion in patients with familial Mediterranean fever: correlation with MEFV genotype. OBJECTIVES: To define in patients affected by familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) whether or not interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 secretion (1) is enhanced, (2) correlates with the type of MEFV mutation and (3) is mediated by NLRP3. METHODS: Freshly isolated monocytes from 21 patients with FMF (12 homozygous and 9 heterozygous), 14 MEFV healthy carriers and 30 healthy donors (HDs), unstimulated or after lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation, were analysed for redox state (production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant responses) and IL-1\u03b2 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) secretion. NLRP3 down-modulation was induced by in vitro silencing of the NLRP3 gene. RESULTS: LPS-stimulated monocytes from patients with FMF displayed enhanced IL-1\u03b2 secretion, which correlated with number and penetrance of MEFV mutations. Silencing of NLRP3 consistently inhibited IL-1\u03b2 secretion. As in other autoinflammatory diseases, FMF monocytes produced more ROS than genetically negative cells from HDs. Unlike in cryopyrin-associated periodic fever syndromes (CAPS), however, they were characterised by a conserved and sustained antioxidant response. Consistent with this finding, activated MEFV-mutated monocytes did not exhibit the functional indicators of oxidative stress observed in CAPS, including accelerated IL-1\u03b2 secretion and deficient production of IL-1Ra. CONCLUSIONS: MEFV-mutated monocytes display enhanced IL-1\u03b2 secretion, which correlates with number of high-penetrance mutations and level of endogenous ROS. Unlike NLRP3-mutated cells, monocytes carrying MEFV mutations withstand oxidative stress and preserve IL-1Ra production, thereby limiting inflammation. Finally, in contrast with that found in the animal model, the increased secretion of IL-1\u03b2 by LPS-stimulated FMF monocytes is NLRP3-dependent.",
    "Increased expression of lysosomal acid phosphatase in CLN3-defective cells and mouse brain tissue. Juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (Batten disease) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by defective function of the lysosomal membrane glycoprotein CLN3. The activity of the lysosomal acid phosphatase (LAP/ACP2) was found to be significantly increased in the cerebellum and brain stem of Cln3-targeted mice during the early stages of postnatal life. Histochemical localization studies revealed an increased LAP/ACP2 staining intensity in neurons of the cerebral cortex of 48-week-old Cln3-targeted mice as compared with controls. Additionally, the expression of another lysosomal membrane protein LAMP-2 was increased in all brain areas. Knockdown of CLN3 expression in HeLa cells by RNA interference also resulted in increased LAP/ACP2 and LAMP-2 expression. Finally in fibroblasts of two juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis patients elevated levels of LAP/ACP2 were found. Both activation of gene transcription and increased protein half-life appear to contribute to increased LAP/ACP2 protein expression in CLN3-deficient cells. The data suggest that lysosomal dysfunction and accumulation of storage material require increased biogenesis of LAP/ACP2 and LAMP-2 positive membranes which makes LAP/ACP2 suitable as biomarker of Batten disease.",
    "Inhibition by adriamycin of calmodulin-sensitive and phospholipid-sensitive calcium-dependent phosphorylation of endogenous proteins from heart. Adriamycin, a lipid-interacting anti-cancer agent, was found to inhibit phospholipid-sensitive Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of endogenous proteins from the cytosol of the guinea-pig heart. The drug, unexpectedly, also inhibited phosphorylation of separate endogenous proteins in the cardiac cytosol and membranes catalysed by the calmodulin-sensitive species of Ca2+-dependent protein kinase. In both phosphorylation systems, the inhibition by adriamycin was reversed by either phospholipid (phosphatidylserine or cardiolipin) or calmodulin respectively. Adriamycin also inhibited phosphorylation of histone (exogenous protein) catalysed by purified cardiac phospholipid-sensitive Ca2+-dependent protein kinase, but not that by cyclic AMP-dependent and cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinases. It appears that Ca2+-dependent protein phosphorylation systems, regulated either by phospholipid or calmodulin, may represent hitherto unrecognized sites of action of adriamycin. It remains to be seen whether inhibition by adriamycin of these systems is related to the severe cardiotoxicity, the major adverse effect of the drug that limits its clinical usefulness.",
    "Inhibition of RNA lariat debranching enzyme suppresses TDP-43 toxicity in ALS disease models. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease primarily affecting motor neurons. Mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43 cause some forms of the disease, and cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates accumulate in degenerating neurons of most individuals with ALS. Thus, strategies aimed at targeting the toxicity of cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates may be effective. Here, we report results from two genome-wide loss-of-function TDP-43 toxicity suppressor screens in yeast. The strongest suppressor of TDP-43 toxicity was deletion of DBR1, which encodes an RNA lariat debranching enzyme. We show that, in the absence of Dbr1 enzymatic activity, intronic lariats accumulate in the cytoplasm and likely act as decoys to sequester TDP-43, preventing it from interfering with essential cellular RNAs and RNA-binding proteins. Knockdown of Dbr1 in a human neuronal cell line or in primary rat neurons is also sufficient to rescue TDP-43 toxicity. Our findings provide insight into TDP-43-mediated cytotoxicity and suggest that decreasing Dbr1 activity could be a potential therapeutic approach for ALS.",
    "Inhibition of T-type calcium channels and hydrogen sulfide-forming enzyme reverses paclitaxel-evoked neuropathic hyperalgesia in rats. Hydrogen sulfide (H\u2082S), a gasotransmitter, facilitates pain sensation by targeting Ca(v)3.2 T-type calcium channels. The H\u2082S/Ca(v)3.2 pathway appears to play a role in the maintenance of surgically evoked neuropathic pain. Given evidence that chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain is blocked by ethosuximide, known to block T-type calcium channels, we examined if more selective T-type calcium channel blockers and also inhibitors of cystathionine-\u03b3-lyase (CSE), a major H\u2082S-forming enzyme in the peripheral tissue, are capable of reversing the neuropathic pain evoked by paclitaxel, an anti-cancer drug. It was first demonstrated that T-type calcium channel blockers, NNC 55-0396, known to inhibit Ca(v)3.1, and mibefradil inhibited T-type currents in Ca(v)3.2-transfected HEK293 cells. Repeated systemic administration of paclitaxel caused delayed development of mechanical hyperalgesia, which was reversed by single intraplantar administration of NNC 55-0396 or mibefradil, and by silencing of Ca(v)3.2 by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. Systemic administration of dl-propargylglycine and \u03b2-cyanoalanine, irreversible and reversible inhibitors of CSE, respectively, also abolished the established neuropathic hyperalgesia. In the paclitaxel-treated rats, upregulation of Ca(v)3.2 and CSE at protein levels was not detected in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), spinal cord or peripheral tissues including the hindpaws, whereas H(2)S content in hindpaw tissues was significantly elevated. Together, our study demonstrates the effectiveness of NNC 55-0396 in inhibiting Ca(v)3.2, and then suggests that paclitaxel-evoked neuropathic pain might involve the enhanced activity of T-type calcium channels and/or CSE in rats, but not upregulation of Ca(v)3.2 and CSE at protein levels, differing from the previous evidence for the neuropathic pain model induced by spinal nerve cutting in which Ca(v)3.2 was dramatically upregulated in DRG.",
    "Innate immunity to RNA virus is regulated by temporal and reversible sumoylation of RIG-I and MDA5. Sensing of viral RNA by the cytosolic receptors RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) leads to innate antiviral response. How RIG-I and MDA5 are dynamically regulated in innate antiviral response is not well understood. Here, we show that TRIM38 positively regulates MDA5- and RIG-I-mediated induction of downstream genes and acts as a SUMO E3 ligase for their dynamic sumoylation at K43/K865 and K96/K888, respectively, before and after viral infection. The sumoylation of MDA5 and RIG-I suppresses their K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation in uninfected or early-infected cells. Sumoylation of the caspase recruitment domains of MDA5 and RIG-I is also required for their dephosphorylation by PP1 and activation upon viral infection. At the late phase of viral infection, both MDA5 and RIG-I are desumoylated by SENP2, resulting in their K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation. These findings suggest that dynamic sumoylation and desumoylation of MDA5 and RIG-I modulate efficient innate immunity to RNA virus and its timely termination.",
    "Interactions of the Hdm2/p53 and proteasome pathways may enhance the antitumor activity of bortezomib. PURPOSE: p53 is inactivated in many human malignancies through missense mutations or overexpression of the human homologue of Mdm2 (Hdm2), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates p53, thereby promoting its proteasomal degradation. The cis-imidazoline nutlin-3 can disrupt the p53-Hdm2 interaction and activate p53, inducing apoptosis in vitro in many malignancies, including multiple myeloma (MM). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We hypothesized that suppression of Hdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination may augment sequelae of p53 accumulation caused by proteasomal inhibition. We compared the response of MM cells versus several epithelial cancer models to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in combination with nutlin-3. RESULTS: The combination of sublethal concentrations of bortezomib plus nutlin-3 induced additive cytotoxicity against bortezomib-sensitive MM cell lines. Importantly, however, in breast, prostate, colon, and thyroid (papillary, follicular, anaplastic, and medullary) carcinoma cell lines, this combination triggered synergistic cytotoxicity, and increased expression of p53, p21, Hdm2, Bax, Noxa, PUMA, and cleavage of caspase-3 and poly ADP ribose polymerase. Coculture with bone marrow stromal cells attenuated MM cell sensitivity to nutlin-3 monotherapy and was associated with evidence of suppression of p53 activity in MM cells, whereas combined bortezomib-nutlin-3 treatment maintained cytotoxicity even in the presence of bone marrow stromal cells. CONCLUSIONS: This differential response of MM versus epithelial carcinomas to combination of nutlin-3 with bortezomib sheds new light on the role of p53 in bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Concurrent Hdm2 inhibition with bortezomib may extend the spectrum of bortezomib applications to malignancies with currently limited sensitivity to single-agent bortezomib or, in the future, to MM patients with decreased clinical responsiveness to bortezomib-based therapy.",
    "Intermediate filament protein accumulation in motor neurons derived from giant axonal neuropathy iPSCs rescued by restoration of gigaxonin. Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the GAN gene resulting in a loss of a ubiquitously expressed protein, gigaxonin. Gene replacement therapy is a promising strategy for treatment of the disease; however, the effectiveness and safety of gigaxonin reintroduction have not been tested in human GAN nerve cells. Here we report the derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from three GAN patients with different GAN mutations. Motor neurons differentiated from GAN iPSCs exhibit accumulation of neurofilament (NF-L) and peripherin (PRPH) protein and formation of PRPH aggregates, the key pathological phenotypes observed in patients. Introduction of gigaxonin either using a lentiviral vector or as a stable transgene resulted in normalization of NEFL and PRPH levels in GAN neurons and disappearance of PRPH aggregates. Importantly, overexpression of gigaxonin had no adverse effect on survival of GAN neurons, supporting the feasibility of gene replacement therapy. Our findings demonstrate that GAN iPSCs provide a novel model for studying human GAN neuropathologies and for the development and testing of new therapies in relevant cell types.",
    "Intranasal NAP (davunetide) decreases tau hyperphosphorylation and moderately improves behavioral deficits in mice overexpressing \u03b1-synuclein. Genome-wide association studies have identified strong associations between the risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD) and polymorphisms in the genes encoding \u03b1-synuclein and the microtubule-associated protein tau. However, the contribution of tau and its phosphorylated form (p-tau) to \u03b1-synuclein-induced pathology and neuronal dysfunction remains controversial. We have assessed the effects of NAP (davunetide), an eight-amino acid peptide that decreases tau hyperphosphorylation, in mice overexpressing wild-type human \u03b1-synuclein (Thy1-aSyn mice), a model that recapitulates aspects of PD. We found that the p-tau/tau level increased in a subcortical tissue block that includes the striatum and brain stem, and in the cerebellum of the Thy1-aSyn mice compared to nontransgenic controls. Intermittent intranasal NAP administration at 2 \u03bcg/mouse per day, 5 days a week, for 24 weeks, starting at 4 weeks of age, significantly decreased the ratio of p-tau/tau levels in the subcortical region while a higher dose of 15 \u03bcg/mouse per day induced a decrease in p-tau/tau levels in the cerebellum. Both NAP doses reduced hyperactivity, improved habituation to a novel environment, and reduced olfactory deficits in the Thy1-aSyn mice, but neither dose improved the severe deficits of motor coordination observed on the challenging beam and pole, contrasting with previous data obtained with continuous daily administration of the drug. The data reveal novel effects of NAP on brain p-tau/tau and behavioral outcomes in this model of synucleinopathy and suggest that sustained exposure to NAP may be necessary for maximal benefits.",
    "Intrathecal Injections in Children With Spinal Muscular Atrophy: Nusinersen Clinical Trial Experience. Nusinersen (ISIS-SMNRx or ISIS 396443) is an antisense oligonucleotide drug administered intrathecally to treat spinal muscular atrophy. We summarize lumbar puncture experience in children with spinal muscular atrophy during a phase 1 open-label study of nusinersen and its extension. During the studies, 73 lumbar punctures were performed in 28 patients 2 to 14 years of age with type 2/3 spinal muscular atrophy. No complications occurred in 50 (68%) lumbar punctures; in 23 (32%) procedures, adverse events were attributed to lumbar puncture. Most common adverse events were headache (n = 9), back pain (n = 9), and post-lumbar puncture syndrome (n = 8). In a subgroup analysis, adverse events were more frequent in older children, children with type 3 spinal muscular atrophy, and with a 21- or 22-gauge needle compared to a 24-gauge needle or smaller. Lumbar punctures were successfully performed in children with spinal muscular atrophy; lumbar puncture-related adverse event frequency was similar to that previously reported in children.",
    "Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment exerts antioxidant and neuropreservatory effects in preclinical models of Alzheimer's disease. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has shown limited promise so far in human clinical studies on Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet overwhelmingly positive preclinical work in animals and human brain cultures support the notion that the therapy remains potentially efficacious. Here, we elaborate on IVIG neuropreservation by demonstrating that IVIG protects human primary neurons against oxidative stress in vitro and that IVIG preserves antioxidant defense mechanisms in vivo. Based on these results, we propose the following translational impact: If the dosage and treatment conditions are adequately optimized, then IVIG treatment could play a significant role in preventing and/or delaying the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD. We suggest that IVIG warrants further investigation to fully exploit its potential as an anti-oxidant, neuroprotective and synapto-protecting agent.",
    "Intrinsically disordered proteins as crucial constituents of cellular aqueous two phase systems and coacervates. Here, we hypothesize that intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) serve as important drivers of the intracellular liquid-liquid phase separations that generate various membrane-less organelles. This hypothesis is supported by the overwhelming abundance of IDPs in these organelles. Assembly and disassembly of these organelles are controlled by changes in the concentrations of IDPs, their posttranslational modifications, binding of specific partners, and changes in the pH and/or temperature of the solution. Each resulting phase provides a distinct solvent environment for other solutes leading to their unequal distribution within phases. The specificity and efficiency of such partitioning is determined by the nature of the IDP(s) and defines \"targeted\" enrichment of specific molecules in the resulting membrane-less organelles that determines their specific activities.",
    "Isolated posterior cruciate ligament injuries in athletes. The literature is divided as to the necessity of an intact posterior cruciate ligament for functional stability. Presented here is a prospective study of isolated posterior cruciate injuries seen in the acute stage in 13 patients, 6 males and 7 females. The diagnosis of posterior cruciate ligament tear was made clinically and confirmed by arthroscopy. The average age at injury was 22 years. The athletic activity at injury was varied. Hyperflexion was the most common mechanism of injury, followed by pretibial trauma in the hyperflexed knee or in the \"dashboard\" injury. There were seven complete midsubstance tears and five partial tears. Direct visualization of the posterior cruciate ligament was not attained in one patient. All patients were treated nonoperatively on a physiotherapy routine. Average followup was 2.6 years. Patients were clinically examined and subjected to KT-1000 and Cybex testing. All patients were able to return to their previous activity and experienced no limitations with their injured knees. Using Hughston's criteria, subjective and functional ratings were all good. However, only 3 rated good and 10 fair when assessed objectively. We conclude that acceptable functional stability in these patients does not necessarily require absolute static stability. Nonoperative treatment of the isolated posterior cruciate ligament midsubstance injury may be a viable alternative to the difficult repair/reconstruction procedure.",
    "JAMM: a peak finder for joint analysis of NGS replicates. MOTIVATION: Although peak finding in next-generation sequencing (NGS) datasets has been addressed extensively, there is no consensus on how to analyze and process biological replicates. Furthermore, most peak finders do not focus on accurate determination of enrichment site widths and are not widely applicable to different types of datasets. RESULTS: We developed JAMM (Joint Analysis of NGS replicates via Mixture Model clustering): a peak finder that can integrate information from biological replicates, determine enrichment site widths accurately and resolve neighboring narrow peaks. JAMM is a universal peak finder that is applicable to different types of datasets. We show that JAMM is among the best performing peak finders in terms of site detection accuracy and in terms of accurate determination of enrichment sites widths. In addition, JAMM's replicate integration improves peak spatial resolution, sorting and peak finding accuracy. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: JAMM is available for free and can run on Linux machines through the command line: http://code.google.com/p/jamm-peak-finder.",
    "JTV519 (K201) reduces sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca\u00b2\u207a leak and improves diastolic function in vitro in murine and human non-failing myocardium. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ca\u00b2\u207a leak from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via ryanodine receptors (RyR2s) contributes to cardiomyocyte dysfunction. RyR2 Ca\u00b2\u207a leak has been related to RyR2 phosphorylation. In these conditions, JTV519 (K201), a 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative and multi-channel blocker, stabilizes RyR2s and decrease SR Ca\u00b2\u207a leak. We investigated whether JTV519 stabilizes RyR2s without increasing RyR2 phosphorylation in mice and in non-failing human myocardium and explored underlying mechanisms. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: SR Ca\u00b2\u207a leak was induced by ouabain in murine cardiomyocytes. [Ca\u00b2\u207a]-transients, SR Ca\u00b2\u207a load and RyR2-mediated Ca\u00b2\u207a leak (sparks/waves) were quantified, with or without JTV519 (1 \u00b5mol\u00b7L\u207b\u00b9). Contribution of Ca\u00b2\u207a -/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) was assessed by KN-93 and Western blot (RyR2-Ser(2814) phosphorylation). Effects of JTV519 on contractile force were investigated in non-failing human ventricular trabeculae. KEY RESULTS: Ouabain increased systolic and diastolic cytosolic [Ca\u00b2\u207a](i) , SR [Ca\u00b2\u207a], and SR Ca\u00b2\u207a leak (Ca\u00b2\u207a spark (SparkF) and Ca\u00b2\u207a wave frequency), independently of CaMKII and RyR-Ser(2814) phosphorylation. JTV519 decreased SparkF but also SR Ca\u00b2\u207a load. At matched SR [Ca\u00b2\u207a], Ca\u00b2\u207a leak was significantly reduced by JTV519, but it had no effect on fractional Ca\u00b2\u207a release or Ca\u00b2\u207a wave propagation velocity. In human muscle, JTV519 was negatively inotropic at baseline but significantly enhanced ouabain-induced force and reduced its deleterious effects on diastolic function. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: JTV519 was effective in reducing SR Ca\u00b2\u207a leak by specifically regulating RyR2 opening at diastolic [Ca\u00b2\u207a](i) in the absence of increased RyR2 phosphorylation at Ser(2814) , extending the potential use of JTV519 to conditions of acute cellular Ca\u00b2\u207a overload.",
    "K-Ras promotes angiogenesis mediated by immortalized human pancreatic epithelial cells through mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. Activating point mutations in the K-Ras oncogene are among the most common genetic alterations in pancreatic cancer, occurring early in the progression of the disease. However, the function of mutant K-Ras activity in tumor angiogenesis remains poorly understood. Using human pancreatic duct epithelial (HPDE) and K-Ras4B(G12V)-transformed HPDE (HPDE-KRas) cells, we show that activated K-Ras significantly enhanced the production of angiogenic factors including CXC chemokines and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Western blot analysis revealed that K-Ras activation promoted the phosphorylation of Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1/2 (MEK1/2) and expression of c-Jun. MEK1/2 inhibitors, U0126 and PD98059, significantly inhibited the secretion of both CXC chemokines and VEGF, whereas the c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase inhibitor SP600125 abrogated only CXC chemokine production. To further elucidate the biological functions of oncogenic K-Ras in promoting angiogenesis, we did in vitro invasion and tube formation assays using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). HUVEC cocultured with HPDE-KRas showed significantly enhanced invasiveness and tube formation as compared with either control (without coculture) or coculture with HPDE. Moreover, SB225002 (a CXCR2 inhibitor) and 2C3 (an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody) either alone or in a cooperative manner significantly reduced the degree of both Ras-dependent HUVEC invasiveness and tube formation. Similar results were obtained using another pair of immortalized human pancreatic duct-derived cells, E6/E7/st and its oncogenic K-Ras variant, E6/E7/Ras/st. Taken together, our results suggest that angiogenesis is initiated by paracrine epithelial secretion of CXC chemokines and VEGF downstream of activated oncogenic K-Ras, and that this vascular maturation is in part dependent on MEK1/2 and c-Jun signaling.",
    "KIAA1530 protein is recruited by Cockayne syndrome complementation group protein A (CSA) to participate in transcription-coupled repair (TCR). Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is the major pathway involved in the removal of UV-induced photolesions from the transcribed strand of active genes. Two Cockayne syndrome (CS) complementation group proteins, CSA and CSB, are important for TCR repair. The molecular mechanisms by which CS proteins regulate TCR remain elusive. Here, we report the characterization of KIAA1530, an evolutionarily conserved protein that participates in this pathway through its interaction with CSA and the TFIIH complex. We found that UV irradiation led to the recruitment of KIAA1530 onto chromatin in a CSA-dependent manner. Cells lacking KIAA1530 were highly sensitive to UV irradiation and displayed deficiency in TCR. In addition, KIAA1530 depletion abrogated stability of the CSB protein following UV irradiation. More excitingly, we found that a unique CSA mutant (W361C), which was previously identified in a patient with UV(s)S syndrome, showed defective KIAA1530 binding and resulted in a failure of recruiting KIAA1530 and stabilizing CSB after UV treatment. Together, our data not only reveal that KIAA1530 is an important player in TCR but also lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying UV(s)S syndrome.",
    "Keratoconus management: long-term stability of topography-guided normalization combined with high-fluence CXL stabilization (the Athens Protocol). PURPOSE: To investigate refractive, topometric, pachymetric, and visual rehabilitation changes induced by anterior surface normalization for keratoconus by partial topography-guided excimer laser ablation in conjunction with accelerated, high-fluence cross-linking. METHODS: Two hundred thirty-one keratoconic cases subjected to the Athens Protocol procedure were studied for visual acuity, keratometry, pachymetry, and anterior surface irregularity indices up to 3 years postoperatively by Scheimpflug imaging (Oculus Optikger\u00e4te GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). RESULTS: Mean visual acuity changes at 3 years postoperatively were +0.38 \u00b1 0.31 (range: -0.34 to +1.10) for uncorrected distance visual acuity and +0.20 \u00b1 0.21 (range: -0.32 to +0.90) for corrected distance visual acuity. Mean K1 (flat meridian) keratometric values were 46.56 \u00b1 3.83 diopters (D) (range: 39.75 to 58.30 D) preoperatively, 44.44 \u00b1 3.97 D (range: 36.10 to 55.50 D) 1 month postoperatively, and 43.22 \u00b1 3.80 D (range: 36.00 to 53.70 D) up to 3 years postoperatively. The average Index of Surface Variance was 98.48 \u00b1 43.47 (range: 17 to 208) pre-operatively and 76.80 \u00b1 38.41 (range: 7 to 190) up to 3 years postoperatively. The average Index of Height Decentration was 0.091 \u00b1 0.053 \u03bcm (range: 0.006 to 0.275 \u03bcm) preoperatively and 0.057 \u00b1 0.040 \u03bcm (range: 0.001 to 0.208 \u03bcm) up to 3 years postoperatively. Mean thinnest corneal thickness was 451.91 \u00b1 40.02 \u03bcm (range: 297 to 547 \u03bcm) preoperatively, 353.95 \u00b1 53.90 \u03bcm (range: 196 to 480 \u03bcm) 1 month postoperatively, and 370.52 \u00b1 58.21 \u03bcm (range: 218 to 500 \u03bcm) up to 3 years postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: The Athens Protocol to arrest keratectasia progression and improve corneal regularity demonstrates safe and effective results as a keratoconus management option. Progressive potential for long-term flattening validates using caution in the surface normalization to avoid overcorrection.",
    "Knockdown of BMI-1 causes cell-cycle arrest and derepresses p16INK4a, HOXA9 and HOXC13 mRNA expression in HeLa cells. The human oncogene B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (BMI-1) is a member of the mammalian Polycomb group family. The overexpression of BMI-1 is associated with human malignancies. In this study, the effects of knockdown of BMI-1 by shRNA-mediated RNA interference on cell cycle and possible downstream targets in human cervical adenocarcinoma HeLa cells were investigated. As a result, when the shRNA plasmid was stably introduced into the cell line, the mRNA and protein of BMI-1 were specifically down-regulated, and the cells increased in the phase of G1 and cells in S phase significantly decreased by flow cytometric analysis; the knockdown of BMI-1 expression could lead to significant up-regulation of p16INK4a, HOXA9 and HOXC13 mRNA expression, but hTERT and HOXB4 mRNA expression did not change significantly. In conclusion, RNAi-mediated knockdown of BMI-1 expression can induce cell-cycle arrest and up-regulate p16INK4a, HOXA9 and HOXC13 in HeLa cells. Our results suggest that targeting BMI-1 might be a therapeutic potential for the treatment of cancer.",
    "LARVA: an integrative framework for large-scale analysis of recurrent variants in noncoding annotations. In cancer research, background models for mutation rates have been extensively calibrated in coding regions, leading to the identification of many driver genes, recurrently mutated more than expected. Noncoding regions are also associated with disease; however, background models for them have not been investigated in as much detail. This is partially due to limited noncoding functional annotation. Also, great mutation heterogeneity and potential correlations between neighboring sites give rise to substantial overdispersion in mutation count, resulting in problematic background rate estimation. Here, we address these issues with a new computational framework called LARVA. It integrates variants with a comprehensive set of noncoding functional elements, modeling the mutation counts of the elements with a \u03b2-binomial distribution to handle overdispersion. LARVA, moreover, uses regional genomic features such as replication timing to better estimate local mutation rates and mutational hotspots. We demonstrate LARVA's effectiveness on 760 whole-genome tumor sequences, showing that it identifies well-known noncoding drivers, such as mutations in the TERT promoter. Furthermore, LARVA highlights several novel highly mutated regulatory sites that could potentially be noncoding drivers. We make LARVA available as a software tool and release our highly mutated annotations as an online resource (larva.gersteinlab.org).",
    "LOLA: enrichment analysis for genomic region sets and regulatory elements in R and Bioconductor. UNLABELLED: Genomic datasets are often interpreted in the context of large-scale reference databases. One approach is to identify significantly overlapping gene sets, which works well for gene-centric data. However, many types of high-throughput data are based on genomic regions. Locus Overlap Analysis (LOLA) provides easy and automatable enrichment analysis for genomic region sets, thus facilitating the interpretation of functional genomics and epigenomics data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: R package available in Bioconductor and on the following website: http://lola.computational-epigenetics.org.",
    "Lack of association of variants previously associated with anti-TNF medication response in rheumatoid arthritis patients: results from a homogeneous Greek population. Treatment strategies blocking tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) have proven very successful in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), showing beneficial effects in approximately 50-60% of the patients. However, a significant subset of patients does not respond to anti-TNF agents, for reasons that are still unknown. The aim of this study was to validate five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of PTPRC, CD226, AFF3, MyD88 and CHUK gene loci that have previously been reported to predict anti-TNF outcome. In addition, two markers of RA susceptibility, namely TRAF1/C5 and STAT4 were assessed, in a cohort of anti-TNF-treated RA patients, from the homogeneous Greek island of Crete, Greece. The RA patient cohort consisted of 183 patients treated with either of 3 anti-TNF biologic agents (infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept) from the Clinic of Rheumatology of the University Hospital of Crete. The SNPs were genotyped by TaqMan assays or following the Restriction Fragments Length Polymorphisms (RFLPs) approach. Disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28) at baseline and after 6 months were available for all patients and analysis of good versus poor response at 6 months was performed for each SNP. None of the 7 genetic markers correlated with treatment response. We conclude that the gene polymorphisms under investigation are not strongly predictive of anti-TNF response in RA patients from Greece.",
    "Lack of prognostic significance of survivin in pediatric medulloblastoma. Medulloblastoma (MDB) is the most common malignant cerebellar tumor in children. Because of the significant rate of mortality and treatment-related morbidity, the identification of prognostic factors could lead to a more accurate selection of patients who can benefit from a less aggressive therapy and improve risk stratification. Survivin is an inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP), the expression of which has been associated with worse prognosis in MDB. However, both of its subcellular localizations may contribute to tumor progression, and ultimately, survivin subcellular localization prognostic value depends on tumor type biological features. The goal of this study was to analyze these survivin features in the pediatric MDB tumor samples and its impact on clinical outcome. Survivin expression and subcellular localization were accessed by immunohistochemistry in a series of 41 tumor samples. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared using the log-rank test. Survivin expression ranged from completely absent to fully present in a notably higher pattern of nuclear localization than cytoplasmic (19 of 41 versus 4 of 41, respectively). However, survivin expression and subcellular localization were not associated with five-year overall survival or metastasis status at diagnosis, which was the only statistically significant prognostic factor in our series (p = 0.008). Taken together, our results suggest that survivin expression should be further studied in large, multicenter series to determine its accurate impact on prognosis and pathobiology of pediatric MDB.",
    "LepChorionDB, a database of Lepidopteran chorion proteins and a set of tools useful for the identification of chorion proteins in Lepidopteran proteomes. Chorion proteins of Lepidoptera have a tripartite structure, which consists of a central domain and two, more variable, flanking arms. The central domain is highly conserved and it is used for the classification of chorion proteins into two major classes, A and B. Annotated and unreviewed Lepidopteran chorion protein sequences are available in various databases. A database, named LepChorionDB, was constructed by searching 5 different protein databases using class A and B central domain-specific profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs), developed in this work. A total of 413 Lepidopteran chorion proteins from 9 moths and 1 butterfly species were retrieved. These data were enriched and organised in order to populate LepChorionDB, the first relational database, available on the web, containing Lepidopteran chorion proteins grouped in A and B classes. LepChorionDB may provide insights in future functional and evolutionary studies of Lepidopteran chorion proteins and thus, it will be a useful tool for the Lepidopteran scientific community and Lepidopteran genome annotators, since it also provides access to the two pHMMs developed in this work, which may be used to discriminate A and B class chorion proteins. LepChorionDB is freely available at http://bioinformatics.biol.uoa.gr/LepChorionDB.",
    "Ligand-stimulated downregulation of the alpha interferon receptor: role of protein kinase D2. Alpha interferon (IFN-\u03b1) controls homeostasis of hematopoietic stem cells, regulates antiviral resistance, inhibits angiogenesis, and suppresses tumor growth. This cytokine is often used to treat cancers and chronic viral infections. The extent of cellular responses to IFN-\u03b1 is limited by the IFN-induced ubiquitination and degradation of the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor chain 1 (IFNAR1) chain of the cognate receptor. IFNAR1 ubiquitination is facilitated by the \u03b2Trcp E3 ubiquitin ligase that is recruited to IFNAR1 upon its degron phosphorylation, which is induced by the ligand. Here we report identification of protein kinase D2 (PKD2) as a kinase that mediates the ligand-inducible phosphorylation of IFNAR1 degron and enables binding of \u03b2Trcp to the receptor. Treatment of cells with IFN-\u03b1 induces catalytic activity of PKD2 and stimulates its interaction with IFNAR1. Expression and kinase activity of PKD2 are required for the ligand-inducible stimulation of IFNAR1 ubiquitination and endocytosis and for accelerated proteolytic turnover of IFNAR1. Furthermore, inhibition or knockdown of PKD2 robustly augments intracellular signaling induced by IFN-\u03b1 and increases the efficacy of its antiviral effects. The mechanisms of the ligand-inducible elimination of IFNAR1 are discussed, along with the potential medical significance of this regulation.",
    "Limb-Enhancer Genie: An accessible resource of accurate enhancer predictions in the developing limb. Epigenomic mapping of enhancer-associated chromatin modifications facilitates the genome-wide discovery of tissue-specific enhancers in vivo. However, reliance on single chromatin marks leads to high rates of false-positive predictions. More sophisticated, integrative methods have been described, but commonly suffer from limited accessibility to the resulting predictions and reduced biological interpretability. Here we present the Limb-Enhancer Genie (LEG), a collection of highly accurate, genome-wide predictions of enhancers in the developing limb, available through a user-friendly online interface. We predict limb enhancers using a combination of >50 published limb-specific datasets and clusters of evolutionarily conserved transcription factor binding sites, taking advantage of the patterns observed at previously in vivo validated elements. By combining different statistical models, our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and provides interpretable measures of feature importance. Our results indicate that including a previously unappreciated score that quantifies tissue-specific nuclease accessibility significantly improves prediction performance. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through in vivo validation of newly predicted elements. Moreover, we describe general features that can guide the type of datasets to include when predicting tissue-specific enhancers genome-wide, while providing an accessible resource to the general biological community and facilitating the functional interpretation of genetic studies of limb malformations.",

These agents may be used either as monotherapy for the treatment of type-2 diabetes or in combination with other anti-diabetic drugs. The present review highlights the use of linagliptin and other new (DPP-4) inhibitors in the management of type-2 diabetes. The review also highlights advantages, comparative pharmacokinetic, safety profile and other potential uses including potential newer indications of DPP-4 inhibitors and relevant patents. The other potential uses that are not restricted to diabetes include obesity, cardiovascular disease, neurological disease, hepatobiliary disease, wound healing, and other inflammatory illnesses.",
    "Localization of the Lys, Asp, Glu, Leu tetrapeptide receptor to the Golgi complex and the intermediate compartment in mammalian cells. The carboxyl-terminal Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL), or a closely-related sequence, is important for ER localization of both lumenal as well as type II membrane proteins. This sequence functions as a retrieval signal at post-ER compartment(s), but the exact compartment(s) where the retrieval occurs remains unresolved. With an affinity-purified antibody against the carboxyl-terminal sequence of the mammalian KDEL receptor, we have investigated its subcellular localization using immunogold labeling on thawed cryosections of different tissues, such as mouse spermatids and rat pancreas, as well as HeLa, Vero, NRK, and mouse L cells. We show that rab1 is an excellent marker of the intermediate compartment, and we use this marker, as well as budding profiles of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in cells infected with this virus, to identify this compartment. Our results demonstrate that the KDEL receptor is concentrated in the intermediate compartment, as well as in the Golgi stack. Lower but significant labeling was detected in the rough ER. In general, only small amounts of the receptor were detected on the trans side of the Golgi stack, including the trans-Golgi network (TGN) of normal cells and tissues. However, some stress conditions, such as infection with vaccinia virus or vesicular stomatitis virus, as well as 20 degrees C or 43 degrees C treatment, resulted in a significant shift of the distribution towards the trans-TGN side of the Golgi stack. This shift could be quantified in HeLa cells stably expressing a TGN marker. No significant labeling was detected in structures distal to the TGN under all conditions tested. After GTP gamma S treatment of permeabilized cells, the receptor was detected in the beta-COP-containing buds/vesicles that accumulate after this treatment, suggesting that these vesicles may transport the receptor between compartments. We propose that retrieval of KDEL-containing proteins occurs at multiple post-ER compartments up to the TGN along the exocytotic pathway, and that within this pathway, the amounts of the receptor in different compartments varies according to physiological conditions.",
    "Long-term safety and efficacy of teriflunomide: Nine-year follow-up of the randomized TEMSO study. OBJECTIVE: To report safety and efficacy outcomes from up to 9 years of treatment with teriflunomide in an extension (NCT00803049) of the pivotal phase 3 Teriflunomide Multiple Sclerosis Oral (TEMSO) trial (NCT00134563). METHODS: A total of 742 patients entered the extension. Teriflunomide-treated patients continued the original dose; those previously receiving placebo were randomized 1:1 to teriflunomide 14 mg or 7 mg. RESULTS: By June 2013, median (maximum) teriflunomide exposure exceeded 190 (325) weeks per patient; 468 patients (63%) remained on treatment. Teriflunomide was well-tolerated with continued exposure. The most common adverse events (AEs) matched those in the core study. In extension year 1, first AEs of transient liver enzyme increases or reversible hair thinning were generally attributable to patients switching from placebo to teriflunomide. Approximately 11% of patients discontinued treatment owing to AEs. Twenty percent of patients experienced serious AEs. There were 3 deaths unrelated to teriflunomide. Soon after the extension started, annualized relapse rates and gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesion counts fell in patients switching from placebo to teriflunomide, remaining low thereafter. Disability remained stable in all treatment groups (median Expanded Disability Status Scale score < 2.5; probability of 12-week disability progression < 0.48). CONCLUSIONS: In the TEMSO extension, safety observations were consistent with the core trial, with no new or unexpected AEs in patients receiving teriflunomide for up to 9 years. Disease activity decreased in patients switching from placebo and remained low in patients continuing on teriflunomide. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that long-term treatment with teriflunomide is well-tolerated and efficacy of teriflunomide is maintained long-term.",
    "Loss of CD28 expression by liver-infiltrating T cells contributes to pathogenesis of primary sclerosing cholangitis. BACKGROUND & AIMS: T-cell-mediated biliary injury is a feature of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). We studied the roles of CD28(-) T cells in PSC and their regulation by vitamin D. METHODS: Peripheral and liver-infiltrating mononuclear cells were isolated from blood or fresh liver tissue. We analyzed numbers, phenotypes, functions, and localization patterns of CD28(-) T cells, along with their ability to activate biliary epithelial cells. We measured levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1 in liver tissues from patients with PSC and the effects of exposure to active vitamin D (1,25[OH]2D3) on expression of CD28. RESULTS: A significantly greater proportion of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells that infiltrated liver tissues of patients with PSC were CD28(-), compared with control liver tissue (CD4(+): 30.3% vs 2.5%, P < .0001; and CD8(+): 68.5% vs 31.9%, P < .05). The mean percentage of CD4(+)CD28(-) T cells in liver tissues from patients with PSC was significantly higher than from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (P\u00a0< .05). CD28(-) T cells were activated CD69(+)CD45RA(-) C-C chemokine receptor (CCR)7(-) effector memory and perforin(+) granzyme B(+) cytotoxic cells, which express CD11a, CX3CR1, C-X3-C motif receptor 6 (CXCR6), and CCR10-consistent with their infiltration of liver and localization around bile ducts. Compared with CD28(+) T cells, activated CD28(-) T cells produced significantly higher levels of interferon \u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 (P < .05), and induced up-regulation of intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1, HLA-DR, and CD40 by primary epithelial cells (3.6-fold, 1.5-fold, and 1.2-fold, respectively). Liver tissue from patients with PSC contained high levels of TNF\u03b1; TNF\u03b1 down-regulated the expression of CD28 by T cells in\u00a0vitro (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01); this effect was prevented by administration of 1,25(OH)2D3 (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory CD28(-) T\u00a0cells accumulate in livers of patients with PSC and localize around bile ducts. The TNF\u03b1-rich microenvironment of this tissue promotes inflammation; these effects are reversed by vitamin D in\u00a0vitro.",
    "Loss of PLA2G6 leads to elevated mitochondrial lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction. The PLA2G6 gene encodes a group VIA calcium-independent phospholipase A2 beta enzyme that selectively hydrolyses glycerophospholipids to release free fatty acids. Mutations in PLA2G6 have been associated with disorders such as infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy, neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation type II and Karak syndrome. More recently, PLA2G6 was identified as the causative gene in a subgroup of patients with autosomal recessive early-onset dystonia-parkinsonism. Neuropathological examination revealed widespread Lewy body pathology and the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau, supporting a link between PLA2G6 mutations and parkinsonian disorders. Here we show that knockout of the Drosophila homologue of the PLA2G6 gene, iPLA2-VIA, results in reduced survival, locomotor deficits and organismal hypersensitivity to oxidative stress. Furthermore, we demonstrate that loss of iPLA2-VIA function leads to a number of mitochondrial abnormalities, including mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction, reduced ATP synthesis and abnormal mitochondrial morphology. Moreover, we show that loss of iPLA2-VIA is strongly associated with increased lipid peroxidation levels. We confirmed our findings using cultured fibroblasts taken from two patients with mutations in the PLA2G6 gene. Similar abnormalities were seen including elevated mitochondrial lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial membrane defects, as well as raised levels of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Finally, we demonstrated that deuterated polyunsaturated fatty acids, which inhibit lipid peroxidation, were able to partially rescue the locomotor abnormalities seen in aged flies lacking iPLA2-VIA gene function, and restore mitochondrial membrane potential in fibroblasts from patients with PLA2G6 mutations. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that loss of normal PLA2G6 gene activity leads to lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent mitochondrial membrane abnormalities. Furthermore we show that the iPLA2-VIA knockout fly model provides a useful platform for the further study of PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration.",
    "Lucinactant for the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants. Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in premature infants. It is caused by surfactant deficiency and lung immaturity. Lucinactant is a synthetic surfactant containing sinapultide, a bioengineered peptide mimic of surfactant-associated protein B. A meta-analysis of clinical trials demonstrates that lucinactant is as effective as animal-derived surfactants in preventing RDS in premature neonates, and in vitro studies suggest it is more resistant to oxidative and protein-induced inactivation. Its synthetic origin confers lower infection and inflammation risks as well other potential benefits, which may make lucinactant an advantageous alternative to its animal-derived counterparts, which are presently the standard treatment for RDS.",
    "Lysyl oxidase is downregulated by the EWS/FLI1 oncoprotein and its propeptide domain displays tumor supressor activities in Ewing sarcoma cells. Ewing sarcoma is the second most common bone malignancy in children and young adults. It is driven by oncogenic fusion proteins (i.e. EWS/FLI1) acting as aberrant transcription factors that upregulate and downregulate target genes, leading to cellular transformation. Thus, identificating these target genes and understanding their contribution to Ewing sarcoma tumorigenesis are key for the development of new therapeutic strategies. In this study we show that lysyl oxidase (LOX), an enzyme involved in maintaining structural integrity of the extracellular matrix, is downregulated by the EWS/FLI1 oncoprotein and in consequence it is not expressed in Ewing sarcoma cells and primary tumors. Using a doxycycline inducible system to restore LOX expression in an Ewing sarcoma derived cell line, we showed that LOX displays tumor suppressor activities. Interestingly, we showed that the tumor suppressor activity resides in the propeptide domain of LOX (LOX-PP), an N-terminal domain produced by proteolytic cleavage during the physiological processing of LOX. Expression of LOX-PP reduced cell proliferation, cell migration, anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and formation of tumors in immunodeficient mice. By contrast, the C-terminal domain of LOX, which contains the enzymatic activity, had the opposite effects, corroborating that the tumor suppressor activity of LOX is mediated exclusively by its propeptide domain. Finally, we showed that LOX-PP inhibits ERK/MAPK signalling pathway, and that many pathways involved in cell cycle progression were significantly deregulated by LOX-PP, providing a mechanistic explanation to the cell proliferation inhibition observed upon LOX-PP expression. In summary, our observations indicate that deregulation of the LOX gene participates in Ewing sarcoma development and identify LOX-PP as a new therapeutic target for one of the most aggressive paediatric malignancies. These findings suggest that therapeutic strategies based on the administration of LOX propeptide or functional analogues could be useful for the treatment of this devastating paediatric cancer.",
    "MARS: improving multiple circular sequence alignment using refined sequences. BACKGROUND: A fundamental assumption of all widely-used multiple sequence alignment techniques is that the left- and right-most positions of the input sequences are relevant to the alignment. However, the position where a sequence starts or ends can be totally arbitrary due to a number of reasons: arbitrariness in the linearisation (sequencing) of a circular molecular structure; or inconsistencies introduced into sequence databases due to different linearisation standards. These scenarios are relevant, for instance, in the process of multiple sequence alignment of mitochondrial DNA, viroid, viral or other genomes, which have a circular molecular structure. A solution for these inconsistencies would be to identify a suitable rotation (cyclic shift) for each sequence; these refined sequences may in turn lead to improved multiple sequence alignments using the preferred multiple sequence alignment program. RESULTS: We present MARS, a new heuristic method for improving Multiple circular sequence Alignment using Refined Sequences. MARS was implemented in the C++ programming language as a program to compute the rotations (cyclic shifts) required to best align a set of input sequences. Experimental results, using real and synthetic data, show that MARS improves the alignments, with respect to standard genetic measures and the inferred maximum-likelihood-based phylogenies, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Our results show, among others, that the average pairwise distance in the multiple sequence alignment of a dataset of widely-studied mitochondrial DNA sequences is reduced by around 5% when MARS is applied before a multiple sequence alignment is performed. CONCLUSIONS: Analysing multiple sequences simultaneously is fundamental in biological research and multiple sequence alignment has been found to be a popular method for this task. Conventional alignment techniques cannot be used effectively when the position where sequences start is arbitrary. We present here a method, which can be used in conjunction with any multiple sequence alignment program, to address this problem effectively and efficiently.",
    "MMP-2 selectivity in hydroxamate-type inhibitors. Extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent neutral endopeptidases involved in physiological and pathological processes, through the cleavage of extracellular matrix. MMPs are capable of degrading essentially all matrix components, which is crucial for malignant tumor growth, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. The vertebrates MMP family includes at least 26 enzymes (23 have been known in humans) with only MMP-1, 2, and 7 experimentally validated as targets for antitumoral drug design. However, inhibition of MMP-1 has been hypothesized to be the cause of the clinically observed musculoskeletal syndrome when broad spectrum inhibitors are used. On the other hand, MMP-9 is a tricky enzyme, since its inhibition might be useful in treating patients with early-stage cancers, but MMP-9 is an anti-target in patients with advanced disease. So, MMP-9 inhibition should also be prevented. Therefore, selective MMP-2 inhibition arises as a pursued profile for MMP binders. Among them, hydroxamates have been extensively studied as small molecule drug candidates characterized by an effective zinc-binding group plus additional side chains responsible for the selectivity. This article pays particular attention to MMP-2 selectivity on hydroxamate-type inhibitors, especially against MMP-9, and their chemical structure, SAR, general synthetic methods, and molecular modelling studies are here reviewed in order to inspire further design of new effective anticancer agents.",
    "MR enterography of small-bowel lymphoma: potential for suggestion of histologic subtype and the presence of underlying celiac disease. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to evaluate the morphologic appearances of small-bowel lymphoma using MR enterography to identify key morphologic traits capable of providing an association between imaging manifestations and likely histologic diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over a 54-month period, 10 patients with subsequently confirmed small-bowel lymphoma were imaged using a standardized MR enterography technique. Retrospective chart review was performed to detect associated disease processes, such as celiac disease. The morphologic characteristics of each segment with lymphomatous involvement were evaluated with respect to tumor location, tumor size, mural characteristics, fold features, loop dilatation, luminal stricturing, mesenteric or antimesenteric distribution, mesenteric involvement, and signal intensity. RESULTS: Nineteen distinct segments of lymphomatous involvement were identified in 10 patients, and underlying celiac disease was confirmed in six of the 10 patients. This patient group comprised 10 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) of various subtypes. No cases of Hodgkin's lymphoma were encountered. Analysis revealed celiac NHL enteropathy to have a tendency toward localization to a single, long (> 10 cm), smooth continuous bowel segment, often with aneurysmal loop dilatation, in the absence of a distinct mesenteric or antimesenteric distribution. Luminal stricturing was encountered in cases of low-grade lymphoma, whereas mesenteric fat infiltration represented a characteristic of high-grade disease. CONCLUSION: We describe the characteristics of small-bowel lymphoma on MR enterography, identifying a number of key features that may help the interpreting radiologist in suggesting the underlying histologic subtype and whether the presence of underlying celiac disease is likely.",
    "Marfan syndrome patient experiences as ascertained through postings on social media sites. Marfan syndrome (MS) is a connective tissue disorder that affects thousands of adolescents [Population Reference Bureau, 2013]. Some adolescent patients with MS may use social media to express their experiences and emotions, but little is known about what patients choose to share online. To investigate social media content related to Marfan syndrome we used search terms \"Marfan syndrome\" and \"Marfans\" on six different social media sites. The top five recent and popular posts for each site were collected and coded weekly for five weeks. Posts were excluded if they were reshared content or not in English. A codebook was developed using an iterative process to categorize posts and comments. Out of 300 posts collected 147 posts (49.0%) were included for evaluation. Categories of displayed content included personal pictures, memes and pictures featuring symptoms of MS (41.5%) and personal MS experiences (27.1% of posts). One quarter of the posts specifically mentioned a positive experience or how thankful the profile owner was for their life. A unique category of posts (13.7%) referenced Austin Carlile, a celebrity singer with MS, as a role model. Physicians and healthcare providers may consider using social media to understand common MS concerns and to place future health education materials.",
    "Massively parallel sequencing reveals an accumulation of de novo mutations and an activating mutation of LPAR1 in a patient with metastatic neuroblastoma. Neuroblastoma is one of the most genomically heterogeneous childhood malignances studied to date, and the molecular events that occur during the course of the disease are not fully understood. Genomic studies in neuroblastoma have showed only a few recurrent mutations and a low somatic mutation burden. However, none of these studies has examined the mutations arising during the course of disease, nor have they systemically examined the expression of mutant genes. Here we performed genomic analyses on tumors taken during a 3.5 years disease course from a neuroblastoma patient (bone marrow biopsy at diagnosis, adrenal primary tumor taken at surgical resection, and a liver metastasis at autopsy). Whole genome sequencing of the index liver metastasis identified 44 non-synonymous somatic mutations in 42 genes (0.85 mutation/MB) and a large hemizygous deletion in the ATRX gene which has been recently reported in neuroblastoma. Of these 45 somatic alterations, 15 were also detected in the primary tumor and bone marrow biopsy, while the other 30 were unique to the index tumor, indicating accumulation of de novo mutations during therapy. Furthermore, transcriptome sequencing on the 3 tumors demonstrated only 3 out of the 15 commonly mutated genes (LPAR1, GATA2, and NUFIP1) had high level of expression of the mutant alleles, suggesting potential oncogenic driver roles of these mutated genes. Among them, the druggable G-protein coupled receptor LPAR1 was highly expressed in all tumors. Cells expressing the LPAR1 R163W mutant demonstrated a significantly increased motility through elevated Rho signaling, but had no effect on growth. Therefore, this study highlights the need for multiple biopsies and sequencing during progression of a cancer and combinatorial DNA and RNA sequencing approach for systematic identification of expressed driver mutations.",
    "McEnhancer: predicting gene expression via semi-supervised assignment of enhancers to target genes. Transcriptional enhancers regulate spatio-temporal gene expression. While genomic assays can identify putative enhancers en masse, assigning target genes is a complex challenge. We devised a machine learning approach, McEnhancer, which links target genes to putative enhancers via a semi-supervised learning algorithm that predicts gene expression patterns based on enriched sequence features. Predicted expression patterns were 73-98% accurate, predicted assignments showed strong Hi-C interaction enrichment, enhancer-associated histone modifications were evident, and known functional motifs were recovered. Our model provides a general framework to link globally identified enhancers to targets and contributes to deciphering the regulatory genome.",
    "Mechanisms and therapeutic challenges in autism spectrum disorders: insights from Rett syndrome. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A major challenge for understanding neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), is to advance the findings from gene discovery to an exposition of neurobiological mechanisms that underlie these disorders and subsequently translate this knowledge into mechanism-based therapeutics. A promising way to proceed is revealed by the recent studies of rare subsets of ASDs. In this review, we summarize the latest advances in the mechanisms and emerging therapeutics for a rare single-gene ASD, Rett syndrome. RECENT FINDINGS: Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene coding for methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Although MeCP2 has diverse functions, examination of MeCP2 mutant mice suggests the hypothesis that MeCP2 deficiency leads to aberrant maturation and maintenance of synapses and circuits in multiple brain systems. Some of the deficits arise from alterations in specific intracellular pathways such as the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. These abnormalities can be at least partially rescued in MeCP2 mutant mice by treatment with therapeutic agents. SUMMARY: Mechanism-based therapeutics are emerging for single-gene neurodevelopmental disorders such as Rett syndrome. Given the complexity of MeCP2 function, future directions include combination therapeutics that target multiple molecules and pathways. Such approaches will likely be applicable to other ASDs as well.",
    "Mechanistic insight into the relationship between N-terminal acetylation of \u03b1-synuclein and fibril formation rates by NMR and fluorescence. Aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1Syn), the primary protein component in Lewy body inclusions of patients with Parkinson's disease, arises when the normally soluble intrinsically disordered protein converts to amyloid fibrils. In this work, we provide a mechanistic view of the role of N-terminal acetylation on fibrillation by first establishing a quantitative relationship between monomer secondary structural propensity and fibril assembly kinetics, and secondly by demonstrating in the N-terminal acetylated form of the early onset A53T mutation, that N-terminal transient helices formed and/or inhibited by N-terminal acetylation modulate the fibril assembly rates. Using NMR chemical shifts and fluorescence experiments, we report that secondary structural propensity in residues 5-8, 14-31, and 50-57 are highly correlated to fibril growth rate. A four-way comparison of secondary structure propensity and fibril growth rates of N-terminally acetylated A53T and WT \u03b1Syn with non-acetylated A53T and WT \u03b1Syn present novel mechanistic insight into the role of N-terminal acetylation in amyloid fibril formation. We show that N-terminal acetylation inhibits the formation of the \"fibrillation promoting\" transient helix at residues 14-31 resulting from the A53T mutation in the non-acetylated variant and supports the formation of the \"fibrillation inhibiting\" transient helix in residues 1-12 thereby resulting in slower fibrillation rates relative to the previously studied non-acetylated A53T variant. Our results highlight the critical interplay of the region-specific transient secondary structure of the N-terminal region with fibrillation, and the inhibitory role of the N-terminal acetyl group in fibril formation.",
    "Metatranscriptomic approach to analyze the functional human gut microbiota. The human gut is the natural habitat for a large and dynamic bacterial community that has a great relevance for health. Metagenomics is increasing our knowledge of gene content as well as of functional and genetic variability in this microbiome. However, little is known about the active bacteria and their function(s) in the gastrointestinal tract. We performed a metatranscriptomic study on ten healthy volunteers to elucidate the active members of the gut microbiome and their functionality under conditions of health. First, the microbial cDNAs obtained from each sample were sequenced using 454 technology. The analysis of 16S transcripts showed the phylogenetic structure of the active microbial community. Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Prevotellaceae, and Rickenellaceae were the predominant families detected in the active microbiota. The characterization of mRNAs revealed a uniform functional pattern in healthy individuals. The main functional roles of the gut microbiota were carbohydrate metabolism, energy production and synthesis of cellular components. In contrast, housekeeping activities such as amino acid and lipid metabolism were underrepresented in the metatranscriptome. Our results provide new insights into the functionality of the complex gut microbiota in healthy individuals. In this RNA-based survey, we also detected small RNAs, which are important regulatory elements in prokaryotic physiology and pathogenicity.",
    "MethPed: an R package for the identification of pediatric brain tumor subtypes. BACKGROUND: DNA methylation profiling of pediatric brain tumors offers a new way of diagnosing and subgrouping these tumors which improves current clinical diagnostics based on histopathology. We have therefore developed the MethPed classifier, which is a multiclass random forest algorithm, based on DNA methylation profiles from many subgroups of pediatric brain tumors. RESULTS: We developed an R package that implements the MethPed classifier, making it easily available and accessible. The package can be used for estimating the probability that an unknown sample belongs to each of nine pediatric brain tumor diagnoses/subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: The MethPed R package efficiently classifies pediatric brain tumors using the developed MethPed classifier. MethPed is available via Bioconductor: http://bioconductor.org/packages/MethPed/.",
    "Mice lacking sister chromatid cohesion protein PDS5B exhibit developmental abnormalities reminiscent of Cornelia de Lange syndrome. PDS5B is a sister chromatid cohesion protein that is crucial for faithful segregation of duplicated chromosomes in lower organisms. Mutations in cohesion proteins are associated with the developmental disorder Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) in humans. To delineate the physiological roles of PDS5B in mammals, we generated mice lacking PDS5B (APRIN). Pds5B-deficient mice died shortly after birth. They exhibited multiple congenital anomalies, including heart defects, cleft palate, fusion of the ribs, short limbs, distal colon aganglionosis, abnormal migration and axonal projections of sympathetic neurons, and germ cell depletion, many of which are similar to abnormalities found in humans with CdLS. Unexpectedly, we found no cohesion defects in Pds5B(-/-) cells and detected high PDS5B expression in post-mitotic neurons in the brain. These results, along with the developmental anomalies of Pds5B(-/-) mice, the presence of a DNA-binding domain in PDS5B in vertebrates and its nucleolar localization, suggest that PDS5B and the cohesin complex have important functions beyond their role in chromosomal dynamics.",
    "Microsporidia infection of the cornea--a unique and challenging disease. Microsporidia are a diverse group of obligate, intracellular, eukaryotic, spore-forming parasites. Traditionally, these were considered as protozoans but recently have been reclassified as fungi. Microsporidia behave as opportunistic pathogens causing systemic infections. In the eye, Microsporidia cause keratoconjunctivitis, corneal stromal keratitis, scleritis, and endophthalmitis. This review shares our experiences with anterior segment infections caused by this pathogen. Keratoconjunctivitis is a common form of ocular infection caused by the parasite. Although early reports described it as occurring only in immunosuppressed individuals, it can also occur in immunocompetent individuals. The disease shows a seasonal pattern with a peak incidence during the rainy season. Although several drugs have been considered, our experience suggests that keratoconjunctivitis is a self-limiting disease. In contrast to keratoconjunctivitis, stromal keratitis is an ill-defined disease. We collected 30 cases and analyzed the various aspects of this disease. Stromal keratitis is characterized by a slowly progressive course. The corneal picture resembles herpes simplex virus stromal keratitis or fungal keratitis cases, and is characterized by deep stromal infiltrates with overlying and surrounding stromal edema and keratic precipitates. The diagnosis of Microsporidia infection is confirmed by a microscopic examination of smears from patients with ulcerative keratitis or by a histopathological examination of corneal tissues. Definitive genus identification requires the examination of specimens by electron microscopy or by molecular methods. In the absence of a definitive medical treatment, nearly all patients require surgical treatment. The confusion regarding Microsporidia is not only limited to their classification but also extends to various aspects of the corneal disease caused by them.",
    "Microtubule-stabilizing peptides and small molecules protecting axonal transport and brain function: focus on davunetide (NAP). This review focuses on the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of action of NAP (davunetide), an eight amino acid snippet derived from activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) which was discovered in our laboratory. We have recently described the effects of NAP in neurodegenerative disorders, and we now review the beneficial effects of NAP and other microtubule-stabilizing agents on impairments in axonal transport. Experiments in animal models of microtubule-deficiency including tauopathy (spanning from drosophila to mammals) showed protection of axonal transport by microtubule-stabilizers and NAP, which was coupled to motor and cognitive protection. Clinical trials with NAP (davunetide) are reviewed paving the path to future developments.",
    "Microwave and magnetic (M(2) ) proteomics of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis animal model of multiple sclerosis. We hypothesized that quantitative MS/MS-based proteomics at multiple time points, incorporating rapid microwave and magnetic (M(2) ) sample preparation, could enable relative protein expression to be correlated to disease progression in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal model of multiple sclerosis. To test our hypothesis, microwave-assisted reduction/alkylation/digestion of proteins from brain tissue lysates bound to C8 magnetic beads and microwave-assisted isobaric chemical labeling were performed of released peptides, in 90 s prior to unbiased proteomic analysis. Disease progression in EAE was assessed by scoring clinical EAE disease severity and confirmed by histopathologic evaluation for central nervous system inflammation. Decoding the expression of 283 top-ranked proteins (p <0.05) at each time point relative to their expression at the peak of disease, from a total of 1191 proteins observed in four technical replicates, revealed a strong statistical correlation to EAE disease score, particularly for the following four proteins that closely mirror disease progression: 14-3-3\u03b5 (p = 3.4E-6); GPI (p = 2.1E-5); PLP1 (p = 8.0E-4); PRX1 (p = 1.7E-4). These results were confirmed by Western blotting, signaling pathway analysis, and hierarchical clustering of EAE risk groups. While validation in a larger cohort is underway, we conclude that M(2) proteomics is a rapid method to quantify putative prognostic/predictive protein biomarkers and therapeutic targets of disease progression in the EAE animal model of multiple sclerosis.",
    "Mirabegron relaxes urethral smooth muscle by a dual mechanism involving \u03b23 -adrenoceptor activation and \u03b11 -adrenoceptor blockade. LINKED ARTICLE: This article is commented on by Michel, M. C., pp. 429-430 of this issue. To view this commentary visit http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bph.13379. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mirabegron is the first \u03b23 -adrenoceptor agonist approved for treatment of overactive bladder syndrome. This study aimed to investigate the effects of \u03b23 -adrenoceptor agonist mirabegron in mouse urethra. The possibility that mirabegron also exerts \u03b11 -adrenoceptor antagonism was also tested in rat smooth muscle preparations presenting \u03b11A - (vas deferens and prostate), \u03b11D - (aorta) and \u03b11B -adrenoceptors (spleen). EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Functional assays were carried out in mouse and rat isolated tissues. Competition assays for the specific binding of [(3) H]prazosin to membrane preparations of HEK-293 cells expressing each of the human \u03b11 -adrenoceptors, as well as \u03b2-adrenoceptor mRNA expression and cyclic AMP measurements in mouse urethra, were performed. KEY RESULTS: Mirabegron produced concentration-dependent urethral relaxations that were shifted to the right by the selective \u03b23 -adrenoceptor antagonist L-748,337 but unaffected by \u03b21 - and \u03b22 -adrenoceptor antagonists (atenolol and ICI-118,551 respectively). Mirabegron-induced relaxations were enhanced by the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram, and the agonist stimulated cAMP synthesis. Mirabegron also produced rightward shifts in urethral contractions induced by the \u03b11 -adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine. Schild regression analysis revealed that mirabegron behaves as a competitive antagonist of \u03b11 -adrenoceptors in urethra, vas deferens and prostate (\u03b11A -adrenoceptor, pA2 \u00a0\u2245\u00a05.6) and aorta (\u03b11D -adrenoceptor, pA2 \u00a0\u2245\u00a05.4) but not in spleen (\u03b11B -adrenoceptor). The affinities estimated for mirabegron in functional assays were consistent with those estimated in radioligand binding with human recombinant \u03b11A - and \u03b11D -adrenoceptors (pKi \u00a0\u2245\u00a06.0). CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The effects of mirabegron in urethral smooth muscle are the result of \u03b23 -adrenoceptor agonism together with \u03b11A and \u03b11D -adrenoceptor antagonism.",
    "Mis-sesnse mutations in Tafazzin (TAZ) that escort to mild clinical symptoms of Barth syndrome is owed to the minimal inhibitory effect of the mutations on the enzyme function: In-silico evidence. Tafazzin (EC 2.3.1.23) is a Phospholipid Transacylase involved in Cardiolipin remodeling on mitochondrial membrane and coded by TAZ gene (Cytogenetic Location: Xq28) in human. Its mutations cause Barth syndrome (MIM ID: #302060)/3-Methyl Glutaconyl Aciduria Type II, an inborn error of metabolism often leading to foetal or infantile fatality. Nevertheless, some mis-sense mutations result in mild clinical symptoms. To evaluate the rationale of mild symptoms and for an insight of Tafazzin active site, sequence based and structure based ramifications of wild and mutant Tafazzins were compared in-silico. Sequence based domain predictions, surface accessibilities on substitution & conserved catalytic sites with statistical drifts, as well as thermal stability changes for the mutations and the interaction analysis of Tafazzin were performed. Crystal structure of Tafazzin is not yet resolved experimentally, therefore 3D coordinates of Tafazzin and its mutants were spawned through homology modeling. Energetically minimized and structurally validated models were used for comparative docking simulations. We analyzed active site geometry of the models in addition to calculating overall substrate binding efficiencies for each of the enzyme-ligand complex deduced from binding energies instead of comparing only the docking scores. Also, individual binding energies of catalytic residues on conserved HX4D motif of Acyltransferase superfamily present in Tafazzins were estimated. This work elucidates the basis of mild symptoms in patients with mis-sense mutations, identifies the most pathogenic mutant among others in the study and also divulges the critical role of HX4D domain towards successful transacylation by Taffazin. The in-silico observations are in complete agreement with clinical findings reported for the patients with mutations.",
    "Mitosis-specific phosphorylation of PML at T409 regulates spindle checkpoint. During mitosis, Promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML NBs) change dramatically in morphology and composition, but little is known about function of PML in mitosis. Here, we show that PML is phosphorylated at T409 (PML p409) in a mitosis-specific manner. More importantly, PML p409 contributes to maintain the duration of pro-metaphase and regulates spindle checkpoint. Deficient PML p409 caused a shortening of pro-metaphase and challenged the nocodazole-triggered mitotic arrest. T409A mutation led to a higher frequency of misaligned chromosomes on metaphase plate, and subsequently death in late mitosis. In addition, inhibition of PML p409 repressed growth of tumor cells, suggesting that PML p409 is a potential target for cancer therapy. Collectively, our study demonstrated an important phosphorylated site of PML, which contributed to explore the role of PML in mitosis.",
    "Modifications of the bladder wall (organ damage) in patients with bladder outlet obstruction: ultrasound parameters. INTRODUCTION: Progressive changes in the bladder wall are observed in men with lower urinary tract obstruction secondary to benign prostatic enlargement (BPE). The high pressure voiding causes initially an increase in the proportion of smooth muscle (hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the detrusor) that develops to major changes in the advanced stages of bladder decompensationi (fibrosis), hyperactivity and decreased functional capacity. Early identification of bladder changes by noninvasive transabdominal ultrasound can suggest therapeutic choices that can prevent further organ damage in the bladder wall. Aim of our study is to review ultrasound (US) parameters, that could be considered reliable and reproducible, in order to demonstrate the damage of the bladder wall. METHODS: We performed a literature review to detect reported US parameters according to our aims. Our clinical experience was evaluated in retrospective manner to detect feasibility and limitations of the evaluation of these parameters in men with different degrees of bladder damage secondary to BPE. RESULTS: Measurement of the bladder wall thickness (BWT) or detrusor wall thickness (DWT) by US is reliable, with at least 3 measurements of the anterior bladder wall taken at a filling volume of 250 ml. In particular, the DWT [thickness of the hypoechoic muscle between two hyperechoic layers corresponding to serosa and mucosa] is considered the best diagnostic tool to measure detrusor hypertrophy using cut-off value > 2.9 mm in men. US derived measurements of bladder weight (Estimated Bladder Weight, EBW) is another noninvasive tool for assessing bladder modifications in patients with bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) with a cut-off value of 35 gr. Technique for measuring the BWT and EBW relies on conventional US 7.5-4 MHz using the automatic system of computation (BVM 6500 3.7 MHz). The variability of intra-operator (4.6 to 5.1%) and interoperator measurements (12.3%) is acceptable. Also conventional US detects established signs of bladder damage: diverticulosis, trabecolations in the bladder wall (pseudo-diverticula), calculi and post-void residual urine (PVR) (> 50 cc). Furthermore the Intravescical Prostate Protrusion (IPP), easy measured by transabdominal ultrasound, is strongly correlated to obstruction in men with BPE (cut-off 12 mm). Measurement, scoring and monitoring of the cervico-urethral obstruction in men with symptomatic BPE is possible by the non-invasive US of the bladder wall. Early identification by measuring DWTand EBW in addition to established US paremeters has the advantage of suggest the adoption of therapeutic measures sufficient to prevent progression of bladder damage. CONCLUSIONS: US derived measurements of DWT and EBW are reproducible and reliable. Transabdominal US also detect established bladder damage such as diverticula, stones and PVR, while IPP measurement seems to be correlated to BOO. US bladder parameters are considered potential noninvasive clinical tools for baseline assessment of patients with BOO. In particular noninvasive US parameters could be useful for longitudinal studies monitoring men with lower urinary tract obstruction secondary to BPE.",
    "Molecular mechanisms of inherited ventricular arrhythmias. BACKGROUND: Inherited ventricular arrhythmias such as the long QT syndrome (LQTS), Brugada syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) account for a relevant proportion of sudden cardiac death cases in young patients cohorts. The detailed pathogenetic mechanisms of inherited ventricular arrhythmias are still poorly understood because systematic investigations are difficult to perform due to low patient numbers and the lack of appropriate experimental models. However, recent advances in research and science have identified a genetic background for many of these diseases. PRESENT KNOWLEDGE: In LQTS, various mutations in different genes encoding for cardiac potassium and sodium channel proteins have been identified (\"channelopathy\"), and initial progress in genotype-phenotype correlation is made. Mutations in the cardiac sodium channel gene have also been identified in a subset of patients with Brugada syndrome, whereas a genetic background has not yet been demonstrated in idiopathic VF and right ventricular outflow-tract tachycardia (RVO-VT). Very recently, mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene have been identified in CPVT and in a subgroup of patients with ARVC. Although several chromosomal loci were suggested, no other responsible genes or mutations have been found in autosomal dominant forms of ARVC. However, in Naxos disease, a recessive form of ARVC with coexpression of palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly hair, a mutation in the plakoglobin gene has recently been discovered, thus underscoring the potential role of genetic alterations in cytoskeletal proteins in ARVC. FUTURE PERSPECTIVES: In the next years, significant progress in the genetic diagnosis pathophysiologic understanding of disease mechanisms, genotype-phenotype correlation, and the development of gene- or target-directed treatment strategies can be expected in the field of inherited ventricular arrhythmias. CONCLUSION: This review summarizes the current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms, including aspects of pathoanatomy, autonomic innervation, genetics, and genotype-phenotype correlations with their potential implications for diagnosis and treatment of inherited ventricular arrhythmias.",
    "Monoclonal antibodies - A new era in the treatment of multiple myeloma. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are currently the most investigated therapeutic compounds in oncology, but there is no monoclonal antibody approved in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). Nevertheless several really promising molecules are under investigation in phase III clinical trials. Dominantly daratumumab (anti-CD38) and elotuzumab (anti-CS1) showed extraordinary effectiveness in phase I/II trials. The toxicity was acceptable which is important for their addition to standard anti-myeloma agents like proteasome inhibitors or immunomodulatory drugs. Monoclonal antibodies such as denosumab (anti-RANKL) or BHQ880 (anti-DKK-1) are investigated also in the management of myeloma bone disease. This review is focused on the most promising mAbs, their mechanisms of action and the rationale of use. Practically all available results have been described. If the ongoing trials confirm the efficacy and safety of mAbs, they would become an important part of MM treatment that would be translated in the further improvement of therapeutic outcomes.",
    "Mortality and longevity of elite athletes. The health benefits of leisure-time physical activity are well known, however the effects of engaging in competitive sports on health are uncertain. This literature review examines mortality and longevity of elite athletes and attempts to understand the association between long-term vigorous exercise training and survival rates. Fourteen articles of epidemiological studies were identified and classified by type of sport. Life expectancy, standardised mortality ratio, standardised proportionate mortality ratio, mortality rate, and mortality odds ratio for all causes of death were used to analyse mortality and longevity of elite athletes. It appears that elite endurance (aerobic) athletes and mixed-sports (aerobic and anaerobic) athletes survive longer than the general population, as indicated by lower mortality and higher longevity. Lower cardiovascular disease mortality is likely the primary reason for their better survival rates. On the other hand, there are inconsistent results among studies of power (anaerobic) athletes. When elite athletes engaging in various sports are analysed together, their mortality is lower than that of the general population. In conclusion, long-term vigorous exercise training is associated with increased survival rates of specific groups of athletes.",
    "Mosaic evolution of rodent B1 elements. We have determined sequences of PCR-amplified B1 elements from hamster and rat (Myomorpha), chipmunk (Sciuromorpha), and guinea pig (Caviomorpha). Between three and six B1 subfamilies were found in these species. In the phylogenetic analysis B1 sequences of hamster, mouse, and rat clustered separately from those of chipmunk and those of guinea pig. This is consistent with an independent evolution of B1 elements in separate rodent lineages. We exclude the possibility of convergent mutations to explain certain diagnostic characters within the modern B1 quasi-dimers and view these elements as mosaic structures assembling preexisting mutations. Furthermore, the presence of Alu-like structural motifs supports the hypothesis of the monophyletic origin of Alu and B1 repeats, i.e., from a common 7SL RNA-derived retroposing monomeric element.",
    "Multistep process of FUS aggregation in the cell cytoplasm involves RNA-dependent and RNA-independent mechanisms. Fused in sarcoma (FUS) is an RNA-binding protein involved in pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. Aggregation of mislocalized FUS into non-amyloid inclusions is believed to be pivotal in the development of cell dysfunction, but the mechanism of their formation is unclear. Using transient expression of a panel of deletion and chimeric FUS variants in various cultured cells, we demonstrated that FUS accumulating in the cytoplasm nucleates a novel type of RNA granules, FUS granules (FGs), that are structurally similar but not identical to physiological RNA transport granules. Formation of FGs requires FUS N-terminal prion-like domain and the ability to bind specific RNAs. Clustering of FGs coupled with further recruitment of RNA and proteins produce larger structures, FUS aggregates (FAs), that resemble but are clearly distinct from stress granules. In conditions of attenuated transcription, FAs lose RNA and dissociate into RNA-free FUS complexes that become precursors of large aggresome-like structures. We propose a model of multistep FUS aggregation involving RNA-dependent and RNA-independent stages. This model can be extrapolated to formation of pathological inclusions in human FUSopathies.",
    "Mutational analysis of the U12-dependent branch site consensus sequence. Highly conserved sequences at the 5' splice site and branch site of U12-dependent introns are important determinants for splicing by U12-dependent spliceosomes. This study investigates the in vivo splicing phenotypes of mutations in the branch site consensus sequence of the U12-dependent intron F from a human NOL1 (P120) minigene. Intron F contains a fully consensus branch site sequence (UUCCUUAAC). Mutations at each position were analyzed for their effects on U12-dependent splicing in vivo. Mutations at most positions resulted in a significant reduction of correct U12-dependent splicing. Defects observed included increased unspliced RNA levels, the activation of cryptic U2-dependent 5' and 3' splice sites, and the activation of cryptic U12-dependent branch/3' splice sites. A strong correlation was observed between the predicted thermodynamic stability of the branch site: U12 snRNA interaction and correct U12-dependent splicing. The lack of a polypyrimidine tract between the branch site and 3' splice site of U12-dependent introns and the observed reliance on base-pairing interactions for correct U12-dependent splicing emphasize the importance of RNA/RNA interactions during U12-dependent intron recognition and proper splice site selection.",
    "Mutational and haplotype map of NOTCH3 in a cohort of Italian patients with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), the most common form of familial vascular dementia, is caused by mutations of the NOTCH3 gene. Approximately two hundred pathogenic mutations have been reported within five exons (exons 3, 4, 6, 11 and 19) which accounted for 78% of known mutations in worldwide series. We reported twenty-one NOTCH3 pathogenic mutations (including five novel ones) identified in 53 index Italian patients. Exons 4 (28%), 7 (21%) and 19 (24%) were the most frequently involved. To dissect genetic heterogeneity, we analyzed five haplotyped tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs1044009, rs4809030, rs10426042, rs10423702 and rs3815188) in 95 patients, 39 unaffected pedigree members and 50 healthy controls. SNPs were analyzed using the Illumina VeraCode Universal Capture Beads technology by Allele Specific Primer Extension (ASPE). We identified ten different haplotypes named H1-H10; H1 was the most common haplotype in patients and controls and it was associated with at least twelve out of the twenty-one mutations. Detected mutations were not associated to specific haplotypes while genotyping was compatible with a possible founder effect for the novel p.S396C mutation which clustered in a restricted geographical area of northeast Italy. The results added on to the genetic heterogeneity of CADASIL and emphasized difficulties in designing algorithms for molecular diagnosis.",
    "Mutations in DVL1 cause an osteosclerotic form of Robinow syndrome. Robinow syndrome (RS) is a phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous condition that can be caused by mutations in genes encoding components of the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway. In contrast, germline mutations that act to increase canonical Wnt signaling lead to distinctive osteosclerotic phenotypes. Here, we identified de novo frameshift mutations in DVL1, a mediator of both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling, as the cause of RS-OS, an RS subtype involving osteosclerosis, in three unrelated individuals. The mutations all delete the DVL1 C terminus and replace it, in each instance, with a novel, highly basic sequence. We showed the presence of mutant transcript in fibroblasts from one individual with RS-OS and demonstrated unimpaired protein stability with transfected GFP-tagged constructs bearing a frameshift mutation. In\u00a0vitro TOPFlash assays, in apparent contradiction to the osteosclerotic phenotype, revealed that the mutant allele was less active than the wild-type allele in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. However, when the mutant and wild-type alleles were co-expressed, canonical Wnt activity was 2-fold higher than that in the wild-type construct alone. This work establishes that DVL1 mutations cause a specific RS subtype, RS-OS, and that the osteosclerosis associated with this subtype might be the result of an interaction between the wild-type and mutant alleles and thus lead to elevated canonical Wnt signaling.",
    "Mutations in MED12 cause X-linked Ohdo syndrome. Ohdo syndrome comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by intellectual disability (ID) and typical facial features, including blepharophimosis. Clinically, these blepharophimosis-ID syndromes have been classified in five distinct subgroups, including the Maat-Kievit-Brunner (MKB) type, which, in contrast to the others, is characterized by X-linked inheritance and facial coarsening at older age. We performed exome sequencing in two families, each with two affected males with Ohdo syndrome MKB type. In the two families, MED12 missense mutations (c.3443G>A [p.Arg1148His] or c.3493T>C [p.Ser1165Pro]) segregating with the phenotype were identified. Upon subsequent analysis of an additional cohort of nine simplex male individuals with Ohdo syndrome, one additional de novo missense change (c.5185C>A [p.His1729Asn]) in MED12 was detected. The occurrence of three different hemizygous missense mutations in three unrelated families affected by Ohdo syndrome MKB type shows that mutations in MED12 are the underlying cause of this X-linked form of Ohdo syndrome. Together with the recently described KAT6B mutations resulting in Ohdo syndrome Say/Barber/Biesecker/Young/Simpson type, our findings point to aberrant chromatin modification as being central to the pathogenesis of Ohdo syndrome.",
    "NADPH oxidases regulate CD44 and hyaluronic acid expression in thrombin-treated vascular smooth muscle cells and in atherosclerosis. The intracellular signaling events by which NADPH oxidase-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) modulate vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) function and atherogenesis are yet to be entirely elucidated. We previously demonstrated that NADPH oxidase deficiency decreased atherosclerosis in apoE(-/-) mice and identified adhesion protein CD44 as an important ROS-sensitive gene expressed in VSMC and atherosclerotic lesions. Here, we examined the molecular mechanisms by which NADPH oxidase-generated ROS regulate the expression of CD44 and its principal ligand, hyaluronan (HA), and how CD44-HA interaction affects VSMC proliferation and migration and inflammatory gene expression in apoE(-/-) mice aortas. Thrombin-induced CD44 expression is mediated by transcription factor AP-1 in a NADPH oxidase-dependent manner. NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS generation enhanced thrombin-induced HA synthesis, and hyaluronan synthase 2 expression in VSMC. Hyaluronidase, which generates low molecular weight HA (LMW-HA), is induced in VSMC in a NADPH oxidase-dependent manner and LMW-HA stimulated ROS generation and cell proliferation in wild-type but not p47(phox-/-) VSMC, effects that were enhanced by thrombin pretreatment. Haptotactic VSMC migration toward HA was increased by thrombin in a CD44-dependent manner. HA expression in atherosclerotic lesions and plasma-soluble CD44 and HA levels were higher in apoE(-/-) compared with apoE(-/-)/p47(phox-/-) mice. HA-regulated pro-inflammatory gene expression was higher in apoE(-/-) than apoE(-/-)/p47(phox-/-) mouse aortas. GKT136901, a specific inhibitor of Nox1- and Nox4-containing NADPH oxidase activity, attenuated ROS generation and atherosclerosis and decreased CD44 and HA expression in atherosclerotic lesions. Together, these data suggest that increased CD44 and HA expression and CD44-HA-dependent gene regulation may play a role in atherosclerosis stimulated by NADPH oxidase activation.",
    "NKX2-1 mutations in brain-lung-thyroid syndrome: a case series of four patients. Brain-lung-thyroid syndrome (BLTS) characterized by congenital hypothyroidism, respiratory distress syndrome, and benign hereditary chorea is caused by thyroid transcription factor 1 (NKX2-1/TTF1) mutations. We report the clinical and molecular characteristics of four cases presenting with primary hypothyroidism, respiratory distress, and neurological disorder. Two of the four patients presenting with the triad of BLTS had NKX2-1 mutations, and one of these NKX2-1 [c.890_896del (p.Ala327Glyfs*52)] is a novel variant. The third patient without any identified NKX2-1 mutations was a carrier of mitochondrial mutation; this raises the possibility of mitochondrial mutations contributing to thyroid dysgenesis. Although rare, the triad of congenital hypothyroidism, neurological, and respiratory signs is highly suggestive of NKX2-1 anomalies. Screening for NKX2-1 mutations in patients with thyroid, lung, and neurological abnormalities will enable a unifying diagnosis and genetic counseling for the affected families. In addition, identification of an NKX2-1 defect would be helpful in allaying the concerns about inadequate thyroxine supplementation as the cause of neurological defects observed in some children with congenital hypothyroidism.",
    "Naltrexone/bupropion for the treatment of obesity and obesity with Type 2 diabetes. Contrave(\u00ae) is a combination of naltrexone hydrochloride extended release and bupropion hydrochloride extended release for the treatment of obesity, and is used with lifestyle modification. Its safety and efficacy were assessed in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 56-week Phase III clinical trials in 4536 adult subjects: COR-1, COR-II, COR-BMOD and COR-DM. All four studies demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful weight loss following up to 52 weeks of treatment with naltrexone/bupropion compared with placebo. The average weight loss from baseline across the four studies was approximately 11-22 lbs (5-9 kg). Results show the efficacy of Contrave for weight loss, as well as significant improvements in cardiometabolic markers. This review focuses on the four studies, their outcomes and the mechanism of action of Contrave.",
    "Negative feedback regulation of Wnt signaling by Gbetagamma-mediated reduction of Dishevelled. Wnt signaling is known to be important for diverse embryonic and post-natal cellular events and be regulated by the proteins Dishevelled and Axin. Although Dishevelled is activated by Wnt and involved in signal transduction, it is not clear how Dishevelled-mediated signaling is turned off. We report that guanine nucleotide binding protein beta 2 (Gnb2; Gbeta2) bound to Axin and Gbeta2 inhibited Wnt mediated reporter activity. The inhibition involved reduction of the level of Dishevelled, and the Gbeta2gamma2 mediated reduction of Dishevelled was countered by increased expression of Axin. Consistent with these effects in HEK293T cells, injection of Gbeta2gamma2 into Xenopus embryos inhibited the formation of secondary axes induced either by XWnt8 or Dishevelled, but not by beta-catenin. The DEP domain of Dishevelled is necessary for both interaction with Gbeta2gamma2 and subsequent degradation of Dishevelled via the lysosomal pathway. Signaling induced by Gbeta2gamma2 is required because a mutant of Gbeta2, Gbeta2 (W332A) with lower signaling activity, had reduced ability to downregulate the level of Dishevelled. Activation of Wnt signaling by either of two methods, increased Frizzled signaling or transient transfection of Wnt, also led to increased degradation of Dishevelled and the induced Dishevelled loss is dependent on Gbeta1 and Gbeta2. Other studies with agents that interfere with PLC action and calcium signaling suggested that loss of Dishevelled is mediated through the following pathway: Wnt/Frizzled-->Gbetagamma-->PLC-->Ca(+2)/PKC signaling. Together the evidence suggests a novel negative feedback mechanism in which Gbeta2gamma2 inhibits Wnt signaling by degradation of Dishevelled.",
    "Nerve growth factor inhibition with tanezumab influences weight-bearing and subsequent cartilage damage in the rat medial meniscal tear model. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the effects of nerve growth factor (NGF) inhibition with tanezumab on rats with medial meniscal tear (MMT) effectively model rapidly progressive osteoarthritis (RPOA) observed in clinical trials. METHODS: Male Lewis rats underwent MMT surgery and were treated weekly with tanezumab (0.1, 1 or 10 mg/kg), isotype control or vehicle for 7, 14 or 28 days. Gait deficiency was measured to assess weight-bearing on the operated limb. Joint damage was assessed via histopathology. A second arm, delayed onset of treatment (starting 3-8 weeks after MMT surgery) was used to control for analgesia early in the disease process. A third arm, mid-tibial amputation, evaluated the dependency of the model on weight-bearing. RESULTS: Gait deficiency in untreated rats was present 3-7 days after MMT surgery, with a return to normal weight-bearing by days 14-28. Prophylactic treatment with tanezumab prevented gait deficiency and resulted in more severe cartilage damage. When onset of treatment with tanezumab was delayed to 3-8 weeks after MMT surgery, there was no increase in cartilage damage. Mid-tibial amputation completely prevented cartilage damage in untreated MMT rats. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that analgesia due to NGF inhibition during the acute injury phase is responsible for increased voluntary weight-bearing and subsequent cartilage damage in the rat MMT model. This model failed to replicate the hypotrophic bone response observed in tanezumab-treated patients with RPOA.",
    "Neurobiological basis of dyskinetic effects induced by antipsychotics: the contribution of animal models. Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a movement disorder characterized by abnormal involuntary facial movements induced by chronic therapy with classical antipsychotic medications. Currently, there is no satisfactory pharmacotherapy for TD, which represents a major limitation to therapy with classical antipsychotics. In order to develop or optimize therapies for TD, and to develop new APDs with lower indices of motor side effects, the pathology underlying TD must first be understood. The use of animal models has been used to further this objective. Here, we review different preparations that have been used to model TD and discuss the contribution of neuroimaging studies conducted in these models. Studies in animal models have lead to several hypotheses of TD pathology, although none has yet emerged as the ultimate underlying cause of this syndrome. We discuss alterations in functional indices, neuron and synapse morphology and changes in specific neurotransmitter systems that have been described in animal models of TD, and outline how these findings have contributed to our understanding of antipsychotic-induced dyskinesias. We conclude that several non-mutually exclusive theories of TD are supported by animal studies, including increases in oxidative stress leading to structural and functional changes in specific neurotransmitter systems. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying TD neuropathology partly through the use of animal models will lead to the development of APDs with superior side effect profiles or more effective therapies for TD.",
    "Neurodevelopment. Parasympathetic neurons originate from nerve-associated peripheral glial progenitors. The peripheral autonomic nervous system reaches far throughout the body and includes neurons of diverse functions, such as sympathetic and parasympathetic. We show that the parasympathetic system in mice--including trunk ganglia and the cranial ciliary, pterygopalatine, lingual, submandibular, and otic ganglia--arise from glial cells in nerves, not neural crest cells. The parasympathetic fate is induced in nerve-associated Schwann cell precursors at distal peripheral sites. We used multicolor Cre-reporter lineage tracing to show that most of these neurons arise from bi-potent progenitors that generate both glia and neurons. This nerve origin places cellular elements for generating parasympathetic neurons in diverse tissues and organs, which may enable wiring of the developing parasympathetic nervous system.",
    "Neuroimaging and clinical characterization of Sotos syndrome. Sotos syndrome is a well-known overgrowth syndrome characterized by excessive growth during childhood, macrocephaly, distinctive facial appearance and learning disability. This disorder is caused by mutations or deletions in NSD1 gene. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between the neuroimaging and clinical features of children with Sotos syndrome. Six Turkish children with Sotos syndrome were followed up about 3-7 years. The diagnosis was confirmed with molecular genetic analysis. We identified the pathogenic NSD1 mutation including three novel in all patients. All the patients had a characteristic facial gestalt of Sotos syndrome consisting of triangular face with prominent forehead, frontoparietal sparseness of hair and small nose. However, the degree of psychomotor and intellectual development was variable. Severe learning defect and speech delay were remarkable in two patients. The neuroimaging analysis showed abnormalities in four of six patients including bilateral large ventricles, thinning of the corpus callosum and persistent cavum septum pellucidum et vergae. Typical craniofacial appearance is the primary finding for the diagnosis of the disease even in the infantile period. However, the degree of psychomotor and intellectual development is very variable and does not correlate with the neuroimaging findings.",
    "New Approaches in Glioblastoma Multiforme: The Potential Role of Immune- check Point Inhibitors. BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent brain tumor. Despite recent advances in treatment approaches the prognosis remains poor, with a median overall survival of 14.6 months. Immunotherapy is the subject of ongoing research and its benefit is becoming evident in other malignancies. Immune check-points such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death receptor (PD-1) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) reduce immune response. OBJECTIVE: To clarify the role of immune check point inhibitors in GBM management. METHODS: Preclinical and clinical trials of immune check-point inhibitors in GBM were obtained by searching for English peer-reviewed articles on PubMed databases, trials registered on clincaltrials. gov and abstracts recently presented at international congresses. RESULTS: Immune check point inhibitors may be of critical importance for the design of future immunotherapy approaches in GBM management. CONCLUSION: Immune check-point inhibitors should be considered a promising treatment option in GBM.",
    "New directions in antiarrhythmic drug therapy for atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia and has a significant impact on morbidity and mortality. Current antiarrhythmic drugs for AF suffer from limited safety and efficacy, probably because they were not designed based on specific pathological mechanisms. Recent research has provided important insights into the mechanisms contributing to AF and highlighted several potential novel antiarrhythmic strategies. In this review, we highlight the main pathological mechanisms of AF, discuss traditional and novel aspects of atrial antiarrhythmic drugs in relation to these pathological mechanisms, and present potential novel therapeutic approaches including structure-based modulation of atrial-specific cardiac ion channels, restoring abnormal Ca(2+) handling in AF and targeting atrial remodeling.",
    "New insights into the promoterless transcription of DNA coligo templates by RNA polymerase III. Chemically synthesized DNA can carry small RNA sequence information but converting that information into small RNA is generally thought to require large double-stranded promoters in the context of plasmids, viruses and genes. We previously found evidence that circularized oligodeoxynucleotides (coligos) containing certain sequences and secondary structures can template the synthesis of small RNA by RNA polymerase III in vitro and in human cells. By using immunoprecipitated RNA polymerase III we now report corroborating evidence that this enzyme is the sole polymerase responsible for coligo transcription. The immobilized polymerase enabled experiments showing that coligo transcripts can be formed through transcription termination without subsequent 3' end trimming. To better define the determinants of productive transcription, a structure-activity relationship study was performed using over 20 new coligos. The results show that unpaired nucleotides in the coligo stem facilitate circumtranscription, but also that internal loops and bulges should be kept small to avoid secondary transcription initiation sites. A polymerase termination sequence embedded in the double-stranded region of a hairpin-encoding coligo stem can antagonize transcription. Using lessons learned from new and old coligos, we demonstrate how to convert poorly transcribed coligos into productive templates. Our findings support the possibility that coligos may prove useful as chemically synthesized vectors for the ectopic expression of small RNA in human cells.",
    "Nitroheterocyclic drugs cure experimental Trypanosoma cruzi infections more effectively in the chronic stage than in the acute stage. The insect-transmitted protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas disease, and infects 5-8 million people in Latin America. Chagas disease is characterised by an acute phase, which is partially resolved by the immune system, but then develops as a chronic life-long infection. There is a consensus that the front-line drugs benznidazole and nifurtimox are more effective against the acute stage in both clinical and experimental settings. However, confirmative studies have been restricted by difficulties in demonstrating sterile parasitological cure. Here, we describe a systematic study of nitroheterocyclic drug efficacy using highly sensitive bioluminescence imaging of murine infections. Unexpectedly, we find both drugs are more effective at curing chronic infections, judged by treatment duration and therapeutic dose. This was not associated with factors that differentially influence plasma drug concentrations in the two disease stages. We also observed that fexinidazole and fexinidazole sulfone are more effective than benznidazole and nifurtimox as curative treatments, particularly for acute stage infections, most likely as a result of the higher and more prolonged exposure of the sulfone derivative. If these findings are translatable to human patients, they will have important implications for treatment strategies.",
    "No evidence found for an association between prednisone dose and FVC change in newly-treated pulmonary sarcoidosis. BACKGROUND: Prednisone is used as first-line therapy for pulmonary sarcoidosis. What dosing strategy has the best balance between effect and side-effects is largely unknown. We analyzed change in forced vital capacity (FVC) and weight during different prednisone doses used in daily practice for treatment na\u00efve pulmonary sarcoidosis patients. METHODS: Multilevel models were used to describe FVC and weight change over time. Correlations were calculated using linear regression models. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were included. FVC changed over time (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), with an average increase of 9.6% predicted (95% CI: 7.2 to 12.1) at 12 months. Weight changed significantly over time (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), with an average increase of 4.3\u00a0kg (95% CI: 3.0 to 5.6) at 12 months. Although FVC and weight changed significantly over time, there was little correlation between prednisone dose and FVC change, while weight increase correlated significantly with cumulative prednisone dose at 24 months. In patients treated with a high cumulative prednisone dose, baseline FVC was on average lower (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) compared to low dose treated patients, while no significant differences were observed in need for second/third-line therapy or number of exacerbations. A strategy leading to a low cumulative dose at 12 months was defined by rapid dose tapering to 10\u00a0mg/day within 3.5 months. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that prednisone therapy aimed at improving or preserving FVC in newly- treated pulmonary sarcoidosis can often be reduced in dose, using a treatment regimen that is characterized by early dose tapering.",
    "Novel aberrant genetic and epigenetic events in Friedreich's ataxia. It is generally accepted that Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is caused by a deficiency in frataxin expression, a mitochondrial protein involved in iron homeostasis, which mainly affects the brain, dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord, heart and in certain cases the pancreas. However, there is little knowledge as to other possible genes that may be affected in this disorder, and which can contribute to its complexity. In the current study we compared human periodontal ligament cells gene expression of healthy individuals and FRDA patients. The expression of active-caspase 3, as well as other apoptosis-related genes, was increased in the FRDA cells. Furthermore, iron-sulphur cluster genes, as well as oxidative stress-related genes were overexpressed in FRDA. Moreover, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neuregulin 1 and miR-132 were all upregulated. These three genes are capable of regulating the expression of each other. Interestingly, when the cells from FRDA patients were co-cultured in the presence of idebenone and deferiprone, caspase expression decreased while antioxidant gene expression, as well as frataxin expression, increased. Regarding epigenetic mechanisms, the frataxin gene was hypermethylated, compared to the healthy counterparts, in the upstream GAA repetitive region. Of the three DNA methyltransferases, DNMT1 but not DNMT3\u05f3s gene expression was higher in FRDA cells. In conclusion, our data show that FRDA cells present altered expression of genes related to cell cycle, oxidative stress and iron homeostasis which may be implicated in the increased apoptotic levels. Also, the altered expression is in a certain degree normalized in the presence of idebenone and deferiprone.",
    "Novel vaccine peptide GV1001 effectively blocks \u03b2-amyloid toxicity by mimicking the extra-telomeric functions of human telomerase reverse transcriptase. GV1001 is a 16-amino-acid vaccine peptide derived from the human telomerase reverse transcriptase sequence. We investigated the effects of GV1001 against \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) oligomer-induced neurotoxicity in rat neural stem cells (NSCs). Primary culture NSCs were treated with several concentrations of GV1001 and/or A\u03b2\u2082\u2085\u208b\u2083\u2085 oligomer for 48 hours. GV1001 protected NSCs against the A\u03b2\u2082\u2085\u208b\u2083\u2085 oligomer in a concentration-dependent manner. A\u03b2\u2082\u2085\u208b\u2083\u2085 concentration dependently decreased viability, proliferation, and mobilization of NSCs and GV1001 treatment restored the cells to wild-type levels. A\u03b2\u2082\u2085\u208b\u2083\u2085 increased free radical levels in rat NSCs while combined treatment with GV1001 significantly reduced these levels. In addition, GV1001 treatment of A\u03b2\u2082\u2085\u208b\u2083\u2085-injured NSCs increased the expression level of survival-related proteins, including mitochondria-associated survival proteins, and decreased the levels of death and inflammation-related proteins, including mitochondria-associated death proteins. Together, these results suggest that GV1001 possesses neuroprotective effects against A\u03b2\u2082\u2085\u208b\u2083\u2085 oligomer in NSCs and that these effects are mediated through mimicking the extra-telomeric functions of human telomerase reverse transcriptase, including the induction of cellular proliferation, anti-apoptotic effects, mitochondrial stabilization, and anti-aging and anti-oxidant effects.",
    "Nuclear and neuritic distribution of serine-129 phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in transgenic mice. Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies are very frequent neurological disorders of the elderly. Mutations in the alpha-synuclein (alphaSYN) gene cause Parkinson's disease, often associated with dementia. Neuropathologically these diseases are characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, intraneuronal inclusions mostly composed of alphaSYN protein fibrils. Moreover, alphaSYN is phosphorylated at S129 (phospho-serine-129 [PSer129]) in neuropathological lesions. Using our (Thy1)-[A30P]alphaSYN transgenic mouse model that develops age-dependent impairment in fear conditioning behavior, we investigated PSer129 immunostaining in the brain. We found distinct staining patterns using new, sensitive monoclonal antibodies. Somal and nuclear PSer129 immunoreactivity increased with age in hippocampal and cortical areas as well as the lateral/basolateral amygdalar nuclei and was present also in young, pre-symptomatic mice, but not wild-type controls. The tendency of PSer129 immunostaining to accumulate in the nucleus was confirmed in cell culture. (Thy1)-[A30P]alphaSYN transgenic mice further developed age-dependent, specific neuritic/terminal alphaSYN pathology in the medial parts of the central amygdalar nucleus and one of its projection areas, the lateral hypothalamus. Interestingly, this type of PSer129 neuropathology was thioflavine S negative, unlike the Lewy-like neuropathology present in the brain stem of (Thy1)-[A30P]alphaSYN mice. Thus, alphaSYN becomes phosphorylated in distinct parts of the brain in this alpha-synucleinopathy mouse model, showing age-dependent increases of nuclear PSer129 in cortical brain areas and the formation of neuritic/terminal PSer129 neuropathology with variable amyloid quality within the fear conditioning circuitry and the brain stem.",
    "OikoBase: a genomics and developmental transcriptomics resource for the urochordate Oikopleura dioica. We report the development of OikoBase (http://oikoarrays.biology.uiowa.edu/Oiko/), a tiling array-based genome browser resource for Oikopleura dioica, a metazoan belonging to the urochordates, the closest extant group to vertebrates. OikoBase facilitates retrieval and mining of a variety of useful genomics information. First, it includes a genome browser which interrogates 1260 genomic sequence scaffolds and features gene, transcript and CDS annotation tracks. Second, we annotated gene models with gene ontology (GO) terms and InterPro domains which are directly accessible in the browser with links to their entries in the GO (http://www.geneontology.org/) and InterPro (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) databases, and we provide transcript and peptide links for sequence downloads. Third, we introduce the transcriptomics of a comprehensive set of developmental stages of O. dioica at high resolution and provide downloadable gene expression data for all developmental stages. Fourth, we incorporate a BLAST tool to identify homologs of genes and proteins. Finally, we include a tutorial that describes how to use OikoBase as well as a link to detailed methods, explaining the data generation and analysis pipeline. OikoBase will provide a valuable resource for research in chordate development, genome evolution and plasticity and the molecular ecology of this important marine planktonic organism.",
    "Oligonucleotide n3'-->p5' phosphoramidates and thio-phoshoramidates as potential therapeutic agents. Nucleic acids analogues, i.e., oligonucleotide N3'-->P5' phosphoramidates and N3'-->P5' thio-phosphoramidates, containing 3'-amino-3'-deoxy nucleosides with various 2'-substituents were synthesized and extensively studied. These compounds resist nuclease hydrolysis and form stable duplexes with complementary native phosphodiester DNA and, particularly, RNA strands. An increase in duplexes' melting temperature, DeltaT(m), relative to their phosphodiester counterparts, reaches 2.2-4.0 degrees per modified nucleoside. 2'-OH- (RNA-like), 2'-O-Me-, and 2'-ribo-F-nucleoside substitutions result in the highest degree of duplex stabilization. Moreover, under close to physiological salt and pH conditions, the 2'-deoxy- and 2'-fluoro-phosphoramidate compounds form extremely stable triple-stranded complexes with either single- or double-stranded phosphodiester DNA oligonucleotides. Melting temperature, T(m), of these triplexes exceeds T(m) values for the isosequential phosphodiester counterparts by up to 35 degrees . 2'-Deoxy-N3'-->P5' phosphoramidates adopt RNA-like C3'-endo or N-type nucleoside sugar-ring conformations and hence can be used as stable RNA mimetics. Duplexes formed by 2'-deoxy phosphoramidates with complementary RNA strands are not substrates for RNase H-mediated cleavage in vitro. Oligonucleotide phosphoramidates and especially thio-phosphoramidates conjugated with lipid groups are cell-permeable and demonstrate high biological target specific activity in vitro. In vivo, these compounds show good bioavailability and efficient biodistribution to all major organs, while exerting acceptable toxicity at therapeutically relevant doses. Short oligonucleotide N3'-->P5' thio-phosphoramidate conjugated to 5'-palmitoyl group, designated as GRN163L (Imetelstat), was recently introduced as a potent human telomerase inhibitor. GRN163L is not an antisense agent; it is a direct competitive inhibitor of human telomerase, which directly binds to the active site of the enzyme and thus inhibits its activity. This compound is currently in multiple Phase-I and Phase-I/II clinical trials as potential broad-spectrum anticancer agent.",
    "One-year safety and tolerability profile of pridopidine in patients with Huntington disease. OBJECTIVE: To assess the 1-year safety profile of the dopaminergic stabilizer pridopidine in patients with Huntington disease. METHODS: Patients received pridopidine 45 mg/day for 4 weeks then pridopidine 90 mg/day for 22 weeks in this 6-month open-label extension (OLE) of the 6-month MermaiHD randomized controlled trial (RCT). Any adverse events (AEs) were recorded. Patients were categorized by their RCT treatment group (placebo, pridopidine 45 mg/day, pridopidine 90 mg/day). RESULTS: Of the 386 patients who completed the RCT, 353 entered the OLE and 305 (86.4%) completed. In 1 year, similar percentages of patients from each group reported > 1 AE (placebo, 79.6% [n = 90/113]; 45 mg/day, 80.8% [n = 101/125]; 90 mg/day, 82.6% [n = 95/115]) and > 1 serious AE (8.0% [n = 9/113], 12.8% [n = 16/125], and 8.7% [n = 10/115], respectively). The AE profile across both studies was similar; falls and worsening of chorea were most commonly reported. During the OLE, more patients previously receiving pridopidine reported > 1 AE (67.9% [n = 163/240]) than those who had received placebo (56.6% [n = 64/113]). Early in the RCT, small increases in heart rate were reported in patients receiving pridopidine. During 1 year, no clinically meaningful changes in laboratory parameters or EKG-related safety concerns were identified. CONCLUSION: Pridopidine ( < 90 mg/day) has an acceptable safety profile and is well-tolerated for 1 year. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence that pridopidine ( < 90 mg/day) is generally safe and well-tolerated in patients with Huntington disease for up to 1 year.",
    "Ophthalmic findings in patients with arterial tortuosity syndrome and carriers: A case series. INTRODUCTION: Arterial tortuosity syndrome (ATS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease hallmarked by tortuosity, stenosis, and aneurysm development of large- and medium-sized arteries. Mutations in SLC2A10, a gene that encodes the facilitative glucose transporter GLUT10, cause ATS. Several case reports have noted associated ophthalmic findings such as keratoconus, keratoglobus, and myopia without detailed descriptions or standardized examinations. We report the ophthalmic findings in a cohort of compound heterozygous ATS patients and heterozygous carriers of SLC2A10 mutations. METHODS: Five ATS patients and three carriers were identified through an ATS specialty clinic at the Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock, Arkansas. Patients underwent complete eye examinations, including corneal pachymetry, topography, and optical coherence tomography when indicated. RESULTS: All five patients with ATS had myopia and thin corneas with an average central corneal thickness of 426 \u00b5m, and three had corneal ectasia, two with early keratoconus and one with keratoglobus and deep stromal corneal opacities. One patient had bilateral high irregular astigmatism, and one had unilateral high regular astigmatism. All carriers had myopia, one had corneal thinning, and one developed keratectasia in one eye many years after laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery. CONCLUSION: We document a spectrum of ophthalmic manifestations of ATS with universal findings of myopia, corneal thinning, and a propensity for corneal ectasia leading to keratoconus or keratoglobus. Heterozygous carriers may develop keratectasia after corneal refractive surgery. Our data support regular eye examinations for all patients carrying SLC2A10 mutations with follow-up tailored to clinical findings.",
    "Oral findings in patients with Apert syndrome. INTRODUCTION: The Apert syndrome is a rare disorder of autosomal dominant inheritance caused by mutations in the FGFR2 gene at locus 10q26; patients with this syndrome present severe syndactyly, exophthalmia, ocular hypertelorism and hypoplastic midface with Class III malocclusion, besides systemic alterations. Most investigations available on the Apert syndrome address the genetic aspect or surgical management, with little emphasis on the oral aspects. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the oral findings, including dental anomalies, ectopic eruption of the maxillary permanent first molars and soft tissue alterations, in subjects with Apert syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical and radiographic examination of nine patients with Apert syndrome, aged 6 to 15 years, not previously submitted to orthodontic or orthognathic treatment. RESULTS: Dental anomalies were present in all patients, with one to eight anomalies per individual. The most frequent anomalies were tooth agenesis, mainly affecting maxillary canines, and enamel opacities (44.4% for both). Ectopic eruption of maxillary first molars was found in 33.3% of patients; lateral palatal swellings were observed in 88.8% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of typical lateral palatal swellings agrees with the literature. The high prevalence of dental anomalies and ectopic eruption may suggest a possible etiologic relationship with the syndrome.",
    "Oral glucocorticoid-sparing effect of mepolizumab in eosinophilic asthma. BACKGROUND: Many patients with severe asthma require regular treatment with oral glucocorticoids despite the use of high-dose inhaled therapy. However, the regular use of systemic glucocorticoids can result in serious and often irreversible adverse effects. Mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to and inactivates interleukin-5, has been shown to reduce asthma exacerbations in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind trial involving 135 patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, we compared the glucocorticoid-sparing effect of mepolizumab (at a dose of 100 mg) with that of placebo administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 20 weeks. The primary outcome was the degree of reduction in the glucocorticoid dose (90 to 100% reduction, 75 to less than 90% reduction, 50 to less than 75% reduction, more than 0 to less than 50% reduction, or no decrease in oral glucocorticoid dose, a lack of asthma control during weeks 20 to 24, or withdrawal from treatment). Other outcomes included the rate of asthma exacerbations, asthma control, and safety. RESULTS: The likelihood of a reduction in the glucocorticoid-dose stratum was 2.39 times greater in the mepolizumab group than in the placebo group (95% confidence interval, 1.25 to 4.56; P=0.008). The median percentage reduction from baseline in the glucocorticoid dose was 50% in the mepolizumab group, as compared with no reduction in the placebo group (P=0.007). Despite receiving a reduced glucocorticoid dose, patients in the mepolizumab group, as compared with those in the placebo group, had a relative reduction of 32% in the annualized rate of exacerbations (1.44 vs. 2.12, P=0.04) and a reduction of 0.52 points with respect to asthma symptoms (P=0.004), as measured on the Asthma Control Questionnaire 5 (in which the minimal clinically important difference is 0.5 points). The safety profile of mepolizumab was similar to that of placebo. CONCLUSIONS: In patients requiring daily oral glucocorticoid therapy to maintain asthma control, mepolizumab had a significant glucocorticoid-sparing effect, reduced exacerbations, and improved control of asthma symptoms.

    "Orientation of DNA replication establishes mating-type switching pattern in S. pombe. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe normally has haploid cells of two mating types, which differ at the chromosomal locus mat1. After two consecutive asymmetric cell divisions, only one in four 'grand-daughter' cells undergoes a 'mating-type switch', in which genetic information is transferred to mat1 from the mat2-P or mat3-M donor loci. This switching pattern probably results from an imprinting event at mat1 that marks one sister chromatid in a strand-specific manner, and is related to a site-specific, double-stranded DNA break at mat1. Here we show that the genetic imprint is a strand-specific, alkali-labile DNA modification at mat1. The DNA break is an artefact, created from the imprint during DNA purification. We also propose and test the model that mat1 is preferentially replicated by a centromere-distal origin(s), so that the strand-specific imprint occurs only during lagging-strand synthesis. Altering the origin of replication, by inverting mat1 or introducing an origin of replication, affects the imprinting and switching efficiencies in predicted ways. Two-dimensional gel analysis confirmed that mat1 is preferentially replicated by a centromere-distal origin(s). Thus, the DNA replication machinery may confer different developmental potential to sister cells.",
    "Orteronel plus prednisone in patients with chemotherapy-naive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (ELM-PC 4): a double-blind, multicentre, phase 3, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. BACKGROUND: Orteronel is an investigational, partially selective inhibitor of CYP 17,20-lyase in the androgen signalling pathway, a validated therapeutic target for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We assessed orteronel in chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. METHODS: In this phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and no previous chemotherapy from 324 study centres (ie, hospitals or large urologic or group outpatient offices) in 43 countries. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 400 mg orteronel plus 5 mg prednisone twice daily or placebo plus 5 mg prednisone twice daily. Randomisation was done centrally with an interactive voice response system and patients were stratified by region (Europe, North America, and not Europe or North America) and the presence or absence of radiographic disease progression at baseline. The two primary endpoints were radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival, determined in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01193244. FINDINGS: From Oct 31, 2010, to June 29, 2012, 2353 patients were assessed for eligibility. Of those, 1560 were randomly assigned to receive either orteronel plus prednisone (n=781) or placebo plus prednisone (n=779). The clinical cutoff date for the final analysis was Jan 15, 2014 (with 611 deaths). Median follow-up for radiographic progression-free survival was 8\u00b74 months (IQR 3\u00b77-16\u00b76). Median radiographic progression-free survival was 13\u00b78 months (95% CI 13\u00b71-14\u00b79) with orteronel plus prednisone and 8\u00b77 months (8\u00b73-10\u00b79) with placebo plus prednisone (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b771, 95% CI 0\u00b763-0\u00b780; p<0\u00b70001). After a median follow-up of 20\u00b77 months (IQR 14\u00b72-25\u00b74), median overall survival was 31\u00b74 months (95% CI 28\u00b76-not estimable) with orteronel plus prednisone and 29\u00b75 months (27\u00b70-not estimable) with placebo plus prednisone (HR 0\u00b792, 95% CI 0\u00b779-1\u00b708; p=0\u00b731). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were increased lipase (137 [17%] of 784 patients in the orteronel plus prednisone group vs 14 [2%] of 770 patients in the placebo plus prednisone group), increased amylase (77 [10%] vs nine [1%]), fatigue (50 [6%] vs 14 [2%]), and pulmonary embolism (40 [5%] vs 27 [4%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 358 [46%] patients receiving orteronel plus prednisone and in 292 [38%] patients receiving placebo plus prednisone. INTERPRETATION: In chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, radiographic progression-free survival was prolonged with orteronel plus prednisone versus placebo plus prednisone. However, no improvement was noted in the other primary endpoint, overall survival. Orteronel plus prednisone was associated with increased toxic effects compared with placebo plus prednisone. On the basis of these and other data, orteronel is not undergoing further development in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

    "Osteonecrosis of the jaws induced by anti-RANK ligand therapy. Since the introduction of bisphosphonates to treat diseases that affect remodelling of bone, increasing numbers of patients with bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws have been reported; the number is currently unknown. Recently anti-RANKL agents (receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand) such as denosumab (Prolia, Amgen Inc., California, USA) that have a similar mode of action to bisphosphonates have been introduced to treat such diseases. We report a case of osteonecrosis that was induced by anti-RANKL therapy. To our knowledge this is the first case to have been induced by these agents.",
    "Oxantel disrupts polymicrobial biofilm development of periodontal pathogens. Bacterial pathogens commonly associated with chronic periodontitis are the spirochete Treponema denticola and the Gram-negative, proteolytic species Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia. These species rely on complex anaerobic respiration of amino acids, and the anthelmintic drug oxantel has been shown to inhibit fumarate reductase (Frd) activity in some pathogenic bacteria and inhibit P. gingivalis homotypic biofilm formation. Here, we demonstrate that oxantel inhibited P. gingivalis Frd activity with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2.2 \u03bcM and planktonic growth of T. forsythia with a MIC of 295 \u03bcM, but it had no effect on the growth of T. denticola. Oxantel treatment caused the downregulation of six P. gingivalis gene products and the upregulation of 22 gene products. All of these genes are part of a regulon controlled by heme availability. There was no large-scale change in the expression of genes encoding metabolic enzymes, indicating that P. gingivalis may be unable to overcome Frd inhibition. Oxantel disrupted the development of polymicrobial biofilms composed of P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, and T. denticola in a concentration-dependent manner. In these biofilms, all three species were inhibited to a similar degree, demonstrating the synergistic nature of biofilm formation by these species and the dependence of T. denticola on the other two species. In a murine alveolar bone loss model of periodontitis oxantel addition to the drinking water of P. gingivalis-infected mice reduced bone loss to the same level as the uninfected control.",
    "PARP inhibition restores extrinsic apoptotic sensitivity in glioblastoma. BACKGROUND: Resistance to apoptosis is a paramount issue in the treatment of Glioblastoma (GBM). We show that targeting PARP by the small molecule inhibitors, Olaparib (AZD-2281) or PJ34, reduces proliferation and lowers the apoptotic threshold of GBM cells in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: The sensitizing effects of PARP inhibition on TRAIL-mediated apoptosis and potential toxicity were analyzed using viability assays and flow cytometry in established GBM cell lines, low-passage neurospheres and astrocytes in vitro. Molecular analyses included western blots and gene silencing. In vivo, effects on tumor growth were examined in a murine subcutaneous xenograft model. RESULTS: The combination treatment of PARP inhibitors and TRAIL led to an increased cell death with activation of caspases and inhibition of formation of neurospheres when compared to single-agent treatment. Mechanistically, pharmacological PARP inhibition elicited a nuclear stress response with up-regulation of down-stream DNA-stress response proteins, e.g., CCAAT enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) homology protein (CHOP). Furthermore, Olaparib and PJ34 increased protein levels of DR5 in a concentration and time-dependent manner. In turn, siRNA-mediated suppression of DR5 mitigated the effects of TRAIL/PARP inhibitor-mediated apoptosis. In addition, suppression of PARP-1 levels enhanced TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in malignant glioma cells. Treatment of human astrocytes with the combination of TRAIL/PARP inhibitors did not cause toxicity. Finally, the combination treatment of TRAIL and PJ34 significantly reduced tumor growth in vivo when compared to treatment with each agent alone. CONCLUSIONS: PARP inhibition represents a promising avenue to overcome apoptotic resistance in GBM.",
    "PBT2 rapidly improves cognition in Alzheimer's Disease: additional phase II analyses. PBT2 is a copper/zinc ionophore that rapidly restores cognition in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A recent Phase IIa double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial found that the 250 mg dose of PBT2 was well-tolerated, significantly lowered cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of amyloid-beta42, and significantly improved executive function on a Neuro-psychological Test Battery (NTB) within 12 weeks of treatment in patients with AD. In the post-hoc analysis reported here, the cognitive, blood marker, and CSF neurochemistry outcomes from the trial were subjected to further analysis. Ranking the responses to treatment after 12 weeks with placebo, PBT2 50 mg, and PBT2 250 mg revealed that the proportions of patients showing improvement on NTB Composite or Executive Factor z-scores were significantly greater in the PBT2 250 mg group than in the placebo group. Receiver-operator characteristic analyses revealed that the probability of an improver at any level coming from the PBT2 250 mg group was significantly greater, compared to placebo, for Composite z-scores (Area Under the Curve [AUC] =0.76, p=0.0007), Executive Factor z-scores (AUC =0.93, p=1.3 x 10(-9)), and near-significant for the ADAS-cog (AUC =0.72, p=0.056). There were no correlations between changes in CSF amyloid-beta or tau species and cognitive changes. These findings further encourage larger-scale testing of PBT2 for AD.",
    "PD-1 Blockade in Advanced Melanoma in Patients with Hepatitis C and/or HIV. On the basis of remarkable antitumor activity, programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab were approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma in the second-line setting following progression on either CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab or BRAF/MEK inhibitors (for BRAF mutated melanoma). Given hypothesized risk of triggering exacerbations of autoimmune diseases and/or chronic viral infections, clinical trials (including regulatory studies) evaluating checkpoint blocking antibodies PD-1 and CTLA-4 have excluded patients with autoimmune diseases, chronic hepatitis B/C virus (HBV/HCV), and/or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. Herein, we describe two patients with advanced melanoma and concomitant HCV/HIV infections treated with PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab. Patient 2 with HIV/HCV coinfection progressed after 2 doses of pembrolizumab. Patient 1 who had HCV alone was treated with pembrolizumab with initial partial response. HCV viral load remained stable after 9 cycles of pembrolizumab following which 12-week course of HCV-directed therapy was commenced, resulting in prompt reduction of HCV viral load below detectable levels. Response is ongoing and HCV viral load remains undetectable. In both patients, no significant toxicities were observed when pembrolizumab was initiated. We argue for the further investigation of checkpoint inhibition in cancer patients with underlying chronic viral infections in the context of carefully designed clinical trials.",
    "PD-L1 testing for lung cancer in the UK: recognizing the challenges for implementation. A new approach to the management of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has recently emerged that works by manipulating the immune checkpoint controlled by programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) and its ligand programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Several drugs targeting PD-1 (pembrolizumab and nivolumab) or PD-L1 (atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab) have been approved or are in the late stages of development. Inevitably, the introduction of these drugs will put pressure on healthcare systems, and there is a need to stratify patients to identify those who are most likely to benefit from such treatment. There is evidence that responsiveness to PD-1 inhibitors may be predicted by expression of PD-L1 on neoplastic cells. Hence, there is considerable interest in using PD-L1 immunohistochemical staining to guide the use of PD-1-targeted treatments in patients with NSCLC. This article reviews the current knowledge about PD-L1 testing, and identifies current research requirements. Key factors to consider include the source and timing of sample collection, pre-analytical steps (sample tracking, fixation, tissue processing, sectioning, and tissue prioritization), analytical decisions (choice of biomarker assay/kit and automated staining platform, with verification of standardized assays or validation of laboratory-devised techniques, internal and external quality assurance, and audit), and reporting and interpretation of the results. This review addresses the need for integration of PD-L1 immunohistochemistry with other tests as part of locally agreed pathways and protocols. There remain areas of uncertainty, and guidance should be updated regularly as new information becomes available.",
    "PHYLUCE is a software package for the analysis of conserved genomic loci. UNLABELLED: Targeted enrichment of conserved and ultraconserved genomic elements allows universal collection of phylogenomic data from hundreds of species at multiple time scales (<5 Ma to\u00a0> 300 Ma).

    "PML isoforms IV and V contribute to adenovirus-mediated oncogenic transformation by functionally inhibiting the tumor-suppressor p53. Although modulation of the cellular tumor-suppressor p53 is considered to have the major role in E1A/E1B-55K-mediated tumorigenesis, other promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body (PML-NB)/PML oncogenic domain (POD)-associated factors including SUMO, Mre11, Daxx, as well as the integrity of these nuclear bodies contribute to the transformation process. However, the biochemical consequences and oncogenic alterations of PML-associated E1B-55K by SUMO-dependent PML-IV and PML-V interaction have so far remained elusive. We performed mutational analysis to define a PML interaction motif within the E1B-55K polypeptide. Our results showed that E1B-55K/PML binding is not required for p53, Mre11 and Daxx interaction. We also observed that E1B-55K lacking subnuclear PML localization because of either PML-IV or PML-V-binding deficiency was no longer capable of mediating E1B-55K-dependent SUMOylation of p53, inhibition of p53-mediated transactivation or efficiently transforming primary rodent cells. These results together with the observation that E1B-55K-dependent SUMOylation of p53 is required for efficient cell transformation, provides evidence for the idea that the SUMO ligase activity of the E1B-55K viral oncoprotein is intimately linked to its growth-promoting oncogenic activities.",
    "PML isoforms in response to arsenic: high-resolution analysis of PML body structure and degradation. Arsenic is a clinically effective treatment for acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) in which the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein is fused to retinoic receptor alpha (RAR\u03b1). PML-RAR\u03b1 is degraded by the proteasome by a SUMO-dependent, ubiquitin-mediated pathway in response to arsenic treatment, curing the disease. Six major PML isoforms are expressed as a result of alternative splicing, each of which encodes a unique C-terminal region. Using a system in which only a single EYFP-linked PML isoform is expressed, we demonstrate that PMLI, PMLII and PMLVI accumulate in the cytoplasm following arsenic treatment, whereas PMLIII, PMLIV and PMLV do not. 3D structured illumination was used to obtain super-resolution images of PML bodies, revealing spherical shells of PML along with associated SUMO. Arsenic treatment results in dramatic isoform-specific changes to PML body ultrastructure. After extended arsenic treatment most PML isoforms are degraded, leaving SUMO at the core of the nuclear bodies. A high-content imaging assay identifies PMLV as the isoform most readily degraded following arsenic treatment, and PMLIV as relatively resistant to degradation. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrates that all PML isoforms are modified by SUMO and ubiquitin after arsenic treatment, and by using siRNA, we demonstrate that arsenic-induced degradation of all PML isoforms is dependent on the ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF4. Intriguingly, depletion of RNF4 results in marked accumulation of PMLV, suggesting that this isoform is an optimal substrate for RNF4. Thus the variable C-terminal domain influences the rate and location of degradation of PML isoforms following arsenic treatment.",
    "PU.1 positively regulates GATA-1 expression in mast cells. Coexpression of PU.1 and GATA-1 is required for proper specification of the mast cell lineage; however, in the myeloid and erythroid lineages, PU.1 and GATA-1 are functionally antagonistic. In this study, we report a transcriptional network in which PU.1 positively regulates GATA-1 expression in mast cell development. We isolated a variant mRNA isoform of GATA-1 in murine mast cells that is significantly upregulated during mast cell differentiation. This isoform contains an alternatively spliced first exon (IB) that is distinct from the first exon (IE) incorporated in the major erythroid mRNA transcript. In contrast to erythroid and megakaryocyte cells, in mast cells we show that PU.1 and GATA-2 predominantly occupy potential cis-regulatory elements in the IB exon region in vivo. Using reporter assays, we identify an enhancer flanking the IB exon that is activated by PU.1. Furthermore, we observe that in PU.1(-/-) fetal liver cells, low levels of the IE GATA-1 isoform is expressed, but the variant IB isoform is absent. Reintroduction of PU.1 restores variant IB isoform and upregulates total GATA-1 protein expression, which is concurrent with mast cell differentiation. Our results are consistent with a transcriptional hierarchy in which PU.1, possibly in concert with GATA-2, activates GATA-1 expression in mast cells in a pathway distinct from that seen in the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages.",
    "Paediatric investigation plans for pain: painfully slow! PURPOSE: To examine the early impact of the Paediatric Regulation, which entered into force in Europe on 27 January 2007, on the development of pharmaceutical drugs in the therapeutic field of pain submitted to the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) and to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). METHODS: Paediatric Investigations Plans (PIPs) submitted with a Decision (outcome) reached between September 2007 and March 2010 were included in the analysis. RESULTS: Of the 17 Paediatric Investigation Plans submitted, 14 have resulted in an EMA Decision, 3 were withdrawn by the applicants, 8 were granted a full waiver from development, and 1 resulted in a negative opinion. Decisions as issued included 15 clinical trials, with at least 1,282 children to be recruited into studies across five different products. Neonates were included in four of the products. CONCLUSIONS: The small number of submissions indicates a lack of new drugs being developed for the management of pain. Ethical concerns that too many vulnerable children will be recruited into clinical trials must be balanced against limiting the number of off-label prescribing and obtaining age-appropriate information on paediatric use. Now is an opportune time for clinicians, academics, learned societies and industry to collaborate for the benefit of children in pain.",
    "Pain-mediated affect regulation is reduced after dialectical behavior therapy in borderline personality disorder: a longitudinal fMRI study. Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is characterized by affective instability, but self-injurious behavior appears to have an emotion-regulating effect. We investigated whether pain-mediated affect regulation can be altered at the neural level by residential Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), providing adaptive emotion regulation techniques. Likewise, we investigated whether pain thresholds or the appraisal of pain change after psychotherapy. We investigated 28 patients with BPD undergoing DBT (self-referral), 15 patients with treatment as usual and 23 healthy control subjects at two time points 12 weeks apart. We conducted an fMRI experiment eliciting negative emotions with picture stimuli and induced heat pain to investigate the role of pain in emotion regulation. Additionally, we assessed heat and cold pain thresholds.At first measurement, patients with BPD showed amygdala deactivation in response to painful stimulation, as well as altered connectivity between left amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. These effects were reduced after DBT, as compared with patients with treatment as usual. Pain thresholds did not differ between the patient groups. We replicated the role of pain as a means of affect regulation in BPD, indicated by increased amygdala coupling. For the first time, we could demonstrate that pain-mediated affect regulation can be changed by DBT.",
    "Pancreatic Islet APJ Deletion Reduces Islet Density and Glucose Tolerance in Mice. Protection and replenishment of a functional pancreatic \u03b2-cell mass (BCM) are key goals of all diabetes therapies. Apelin, a small regulatory peptide, is the endogenous ligand for the apelin receptor (APJ) receptor. The apelin-APJ signaling system is expressed in rodent and human islet cells. Apelin exposure has been shown to inhibit and to stimulate insulin secretion. Our aim was to assess the influence of a selective APJ deletion in pancreatic islet cells on islet homeostasis and glucose tolerance in mice. Cre-LoxP strategy was utilized to mediate islet APJ deletion. APJ deletion in islet cells (APJ(\u0394islet)) resulted in a significantly reduced islet size, density and BCM. An ip glucose tolerance test showed significantly impaired glucose clearance in APJ(\u0394islet) mice. APJ(\u0394islet) mice were not insulin resistant and in vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was reduced modestly. In vitro glucose-stimulated insulin secretion showed a significantly reduced insulin secretion by islets from APJ(\u0394islet) mice. Glucose clearance in response to ip glucose tolerance test in obese APJ(\u0394islet) mice fed a chronic high-fat (HF) diet, but not pregnant APJ(\u0394islet) mice, was impaired significantly. In addition, the obesity-induced adaptive elevations in mean islet size and fractional islet area were reduced significantly in obese APJ(\u0394islet) mice when compared with wild-type mice. Together, these findings demonstrate a stimulatory role for the islet cell apelin-APJ signaling axis in regulation of pancreatic islet homeostasis and in metabolic induced \u03b2-cell hyperplasia. The results indicate the apelin-APJ system can be exploited for replenishment of BCM.",
    "Pannexin2 oligomers localize in the membranes of endosomal vesicles in mammalian cells while Pannexin1 channels traffic to the plasma membrane. Pannexin2 (Panx2) is the largest of three members of the pannexin proteins. Pannexins are topologically related to connexins and innexins, but serve different functional roles than forming gap junctions. We previously showed that pannexins form oligomeric channels but unlike connexins and innexins, they form only single membrane channels. High levels of Panx2 mRNA and protein in the Central Nervous System (CNS) have been documented. Whereas Pannexin1 (Panx1) is fairly ubiquitous and Pannexin3 (Panx3) is found in skin and connective tissue, both are fully glycosylated, traffic to the plasma membrane and have functions correlated with extracellular ATP release. Here, we describe trafficking and subcellular localizations of exogenous Panx2 and Panx1 protein expression in MDCK, HeLa, and HEK 293T cells as well as endogenous Panx1 and Panx2 patterns in the CNS. Panx2 was found in intracellular localizations, was partially N-glycosylated, and localizations were non-overlapping with Panx1. Confocal images of hippocampal sections immunolabeled for the astrocytic protein GFAP, Panx1 and Panx2 demonstrated that the two isoforms, Panx1 and Panx2, localized at different subcellular compartments in both astrocytes and neurons. Using recombinant fusions of Panx2 with appended genetic tags developed for correlated light and electron microscopy and then expressed in different cell lines, we determined that Panx2 is localized in the membrane of intracellular vesicles and not in the endoplasmic reticulum as initially indicated by calnexin colocalization experiments. Dual immunofluorescence imaging with protein markers for specific vesicle compartments showed that Panx2 vesicles are early endosomal in origin. In electron tomographic volumes, cross-sections of these vesicles displayed fine structural details and close proximity to actin filaments. Thus, pannexins expressed at different subcellular compartments likely exert distinct functional roles, particularly in the nervous system.",
    "Partially functional Cenpa-GFP fusion protein causes increased chromosome missegregation and apoptosis during mouse embryogenesis. CENP-A is an essential histone H3-like protein that localizes to the centromeric region of eukaryotic chromosomes. Heterozygous and homozygous Cenpa-GFP fusion-protein mouse mutants, generated through targeted insertion of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene into the mouse Cenpa gene locus, show specific localized fluorescence at all the centromeres. Heterozygous mice are healthy and fertile. Cenpa-GFP homozygotes (Cenpag/g) undergo many cell divisions, giving rise to up to one million cells that show relatively accurate differentiation into distinct mouse embryonic tissues until day 10.5 when significant levels of chromosome missegregation, aneuploidy and apoptosis result in death. Cenpag/g embryos assemble functional kinetochores that bind to a host of centromere-specific structural and mitotic spindle checkpoint proteins (Cenpc, BubR1, Mad2 and Zw10). Examination of the nucleosomal phasing of centromeric minor and pericentromeric major satellite sequences indicates that the formation of Cenpag/g homotypic nucleosomes is not accompanied by any overt alteration to the overall size of the monomeric nucleosomal structure or the spacing of these structures. This study provides the first example of an essential centromeric protein gene variant in which subtle perturbation at the centromeric nucleosomal/chromatin level manifests in a significantly delayed lethality when compared with Cenpa null mice.",
    "Patent foramen ovale closure with GORE HELEX or CARDIOFORM Septal Occluder vs. antiplatelet therapy for reduction of recurrent stroke or new brain infarct in patients with prior cryptogenic stroke: Design of the randomized Gore REDUCE Clinical Study. Rationale The utility of patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure for secondary prevention in patients with prior cryptogenic stroke is uncertain despite multiple randomized trials completed to date. Aims The Gore REDUCE Clinical Study (REDUCE) aims to establish superiority of patent foramen ovale closure in conjunction with antiplatelet therapy over antiplatelet therapy alone in reducing the risk of recurrent clinical ischemic stroke or new silent brain infarct in patients who have had a cryptogenic stroke. Methods and design This controlled, open-label trial randomized 664 subjects with cryptogenic stroke at 63 multinational sites in a 2:1 ratio to either antiplatelet therapy plus patent foramen ovale closure (with GORE\u00ae HELEX\u00ae Septal Occluder or GORE\u00ae CARDIOFORM Septal Occluder) or antiplatelet therapy alone. Subjects will be prospectively followed for up to five years. Neuroimaging is required for all subjects at baseline and at two years or study exit. Study outcomes The two co-primary endpoints for the study are freedom from recurrent clinical ischemic stroke through at least 24 months post-randomization and incidence of new brain infarct (defined as clinical ischemic stroke or silent brain infarct) through 24 months. The primary analyses are an unadjusted log-rank test and a binomial test of subject-based proportions, respectively, both on the intent-to-treat population, with adjustment for testing multiplicity. Discussion The REDUCE trial aims to target a patient population with truly cryptogenic strokes. Medical therapy is limited to antiplatelet agents in both arms thereby reducing confounding. The trial should determine whether patent foramen ovale closure with the Gore septal occluders is safe and more effective than medical therapy alone for the prevention of recurrent clinical ischemic stroke or new silent brain infarct; the neuroimaging data will provide an opportunity to further support the proof of concept. The main results are anticipated in 2017. Registration Clinical trial registration-URL: http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00738894.",
    "Patient with craniosynostosis and marfanoid phenotype (Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome) and cloverleaf skull. Marfanoid phenotype with craniosynostosis (Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome) is a rare disorder previously described in only 5 patients. We report on the sixth known patient with this condition. The findings which distinguish our patient from others reported previously are that she was ascertained prenatally as having a cloverleaf skull; this is the first female patient described with this condition. Postnatally, she presented with arachnodactyly, camptodactyly, and clover-leaf skull. Imaging studies of the brain documented microcephaly with malformed brain, hydrocephaly, and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum. She also had choanal atresia and stenosis, a clinical finding previously reported only once, in this disorder.",
    "Pembrolizumab versus Ipilimumab in Advanced Melanoma. BACKGROUND: The immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab is the standard-of-care treatment for patients with advanced melanoma. Pembrolizumab inhibits the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint and has antitumor activity in patients with advanced melanoma. METHODS: In this randomized, controlled, phase 3 study, we assigned 834 patients with advanced melanoma in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive pembrolizumab (at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight) every 2 weeks or every 3 weeks or four doses of ipilimumab (at 3 mg per kilogram) every 3 weeks. Primary end points were progression-free and overall survival. RESULTS: The estimated 6-month progression-free-survival rates were 47.3% for pembrolizumab every 2 weeks, 46.4% for pembrolizumab every 3 weeks, and 26.5% for ipilimumab (hazard ratio for disease progression, 0.58; P<0.001 for both pembrolizumab regimens versus ipilimumab; 95% confidence intervals [CIs], 0.46 to 0.72 and 0.47 to 0.72, respectively). Estimated 12-month survival rates were 74.1%, 68.4%, and 58.2%, respectively (hazard ratio for death for pembrolizumab every 2 weeks, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.83; P=0.0005; hazard ratio for pembrolizumab every 3 weeks, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.90; P=0.0036). The response rate was improved with pembrolizumab administered every 2 weeks (33.7%) and every 3 weeks (32.9%), as compared with ipilimumab (11.9%) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Responses were ongoing in 89.4%, 96.7%, and 87.9% of patients, respectively, after a median follow-up of 7.9 months. Efficacy was similar in the two pembrolizumab groups. Rates of treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 to 5 severity were lower in the pembrolizumab groups (13.3% and 10.1%) than in the ipilimumab group (19.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival and had less high-grade toxicity than did ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma.

    "Peripartum isolated cortical vein thrombosis in a mother with postdural puncture headache treated with an epidural blood patch. A 32-year-old woman presented with low pressure headache 3 days after delivery of her baby. An assessment of postdural puncture headache was made. This was initially treated with analgesia, caffeine, and fluids for the presumed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. The woman was readmitted two days after her hospital discharge with generalised seizures. A brain scan showed features of intracranial hypotension, and she was treated for CSF leak using an epidural blood patch. Her symptoms worsened and three days later, she developed a left homonymous quadrantanopia. An MRI scan confirmed a right parietal haematoma with evidence of isolated cortical vein thrombosis (ICVT).",

The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of connective tissue disorders characterized by triad of joint hypermobility, skin extensibility, and tissue fragility. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV places patients at risk for life-threatening, spontaneous, vascular or visceral rupture due to reduced or abnormal secretion of type III collagen. We present an adolescent male who was found to have a perisigmoid abscess with a fistula connecting to adjacent sigmoid colon secondary to undiagnosed EDS type IV. Conservative management with antibiotics and bowel rest was pursued to allow for elective resection for his acute complicated diverticulitis at a safer time.",
    "Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of Glecaprevir and Pibrentasvir in Healthy White, Chinese, and Japanese Adult Subjects. Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are direct-acting antiviral agents being developed as combination therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection. The aim of the present studies was to assess the effect of race and ethnicity (white, Han Chinese, Japanese) on the pharmacokinetics and safety of multiple oral doses of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir given alone and in combination. Two multiple-dose, single-center, phase 1 studies were conducted in healthy adult male and female subjects (n = 170) of respective Asian and white race/ethnicity. Glecaprevir (100, 200, 300, or 700\u00a0mg once daily) and pibrentasvir (80, 120, or 160\u00a0mg once daily) were administered alone for 7 days followed by the combination of both direct-acting antiviral agents for another 7 days. Intensive blood sampling was performed, and pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by noncompartmental analyses. ANOVA was employed to evaluate for differences of steady-state glecaprevir and pibrentasvir exposures between Asian (Japanese or Han Chinese) and white subjects. Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir exposures in Han Chinese and Japanese were similar to those in whites across dose levels. The nonlinear dose-exposure relationships for glecaprevir and pibrentasvir were similar across Japanese, Han Chinese, and white subjects, and the safety profiles of the agents were comparable across these groups. The results of these studies demonstrate that race/ethnicity has no clinically meaningful impact on direct-acting antiviral agent exposures, safety, or tolerability of the glecaprevir and pibrentasvir combination. This is supported in part by the large global registration program of the pangenotypic, coformulated fixed-dose glecaprevir/pibrentasvir regimen and allows for inclusion of diverse ethnic populations.",
    "Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical efficacy of dapagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. INTRODUCTION: Dapagliflozin (DAPA) (Farxiga or Forxiga) is a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor approved for type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM) treatment. AREAS COVERED: The review focuses on the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics(PD) and clinical studies published on DAPA. The authors searched PubMed database for English language studies describing DAPA characteristics and use in T2DM subjects published through June 2014. EXPERT OPINION: DAPA exhibits favorable PK and PD properties and is effective in reducing glycemic levels. In addition, DAPA shows beneficial/neutral effects on other risk factors contributing to T2DM metabolic control. Increased risk of genital and urinary infections and episodes of volume depletion represent the major concerns for its use. FDA requires additional data to assess imbalances in bladder cancer and drug cardiovascular safety. The mechanism of action and the very low risk of drug-drug interaction make it an ideal drug for rapidly reducing glucotoxicity and restoring clinical response to other antidiabetic drugs.",
    "Phase 1 study in Japan of siltuximab, an anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody, in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Siltuximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody with high affinity and specificity for interleukin-6, has been shown to enhance anti-multiple myeloma activity of bortezomib and corticosteroid in vitro. We evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and antitumor effect of siltuximab in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. This open-label, phase 1, dose-escalating study used two doses of siltuximab: 5.5 and 11.0 mg/kg (administered on day 1 of each 21-day cycle). In total, nine patients were treated. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events, lymphopenia (89 %) and thrombocytopenia (44 %), occurred in patients receiving both doses of siltuximab; however, no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed. Following intravenous administration of siltuximab at 5.5 and 11.0 mg/kg, the maximum serum concentration and the area under the curve from 0 to 21 days and from 0 to infinity increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner. Mean half-life, total systemic clearance, and volume of distribution were similar at doses of 5.5 and 11.0 mg/kg. Across both doses, six of the nine patients had complete or partial response (22 and 44 %, respectively). In conclusion, as no DLT was observed, the recommended dose for this combination is 11.0 mg/kg once every 3 weeks. The study is registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01309412.",
    "Phase 3 Studies Comparing Brodalumab with Ustekinumab in Psoriasis. BACKGROUND: Early clinical studies suggested that the anti-interleukin-17 receptor A monoclonal antibody brodalumab has efficacy in the treatment of psoriasis. METHODS: In two phase 3 studies (AMAGINE-2 and AMAGINE-3), patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis were randomly assigned to receive brodalumab (210 mg or 140 mg every 2 weeks), ustekinumab (45 mg for patients with a body weight < 100 kg and 90 mg for patients >100 kg), or placebo. At week 12, patients receiving brodalumab were randomly assigned again to receive a brodalumab maintenance dose of 210 mg every 2 weeks or 140 mg every 2 weeks, every 4 weeks, or every 8 weeks; patients receiving ustekinumab continued to receive ustekinumab every 12 weeks, and patients receiving placebo received 210 mg of brodalumab every 2 weeks. The primary aims were to evaluate the superiority of brodalumab over placebo at week 12 with respect to at least a 75% reduction in the psoriasis area-and-severity index score (PASI 75) and a static physician's global assessment (sPGA) score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear skin), as well as the superiority of brodalumab over ustekinumab at week 12 with respect to a 100% reduction in PASI score (PASI 100). RESULTS: At week 12, the PASI 75 response rates were higher with brodalumab at the 210-mg and 140-mg doses than with placebo (86% and 67%, respectively, vs. 8% [AMAGINE-2] and 85% and 69%, respectively, vs. 6% [AMAGINE-3]; P<0.001); the rates of sPGA scores of 0 or 1 were also higher with brodalumab (P<0.001). The week 12 PASI 100 response rates were significantly higher with 210 mg of brodalumab than with ustekinumab (44% vs. 22% [AMAGINE-2] and 37% vs. 19% [AMAGINE-3], P<0.001). The PASI 100 response rates with 140 mg of brodalumab were 26% in AMAGINE-2 (P=0.08 for the comparison with ustekinumab) and 27% in AMAGINE-3 (P=0.007). Rates of neutropenia were higher with brodalumab and with ustekinumab than with placebo. Mild or moderate candida infections were more frequent with brodalumab than with ustekinumab or placebo. Through week 52, the rates of serious infectious episodes were 1.0 (AMAGINE-2) and 1.3 (AMAGINE-3) per 100 patient-years of exposure to brodalumab. CONCLUSIONS: Brodalumab treatment resulted in significant clinical improvements in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.

    "Phospholamban interactome in cardiac contractility and survival: A new vision of an old friend. Depressed sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium cycling, reflecting impaired SR Ca-transport and Ca-release, is a key and universal characteristic of human and experimental heart failure. These SR processes are regulated by multimeric protein complexes, including protein kinases and phosphatases as well as their anchoring and regulatory subunits that fine-tune Ca-handling in specific SR sub-compartments. SR Ca-transport is mediated by the SR Ca-ATPase (SERCA2a) and its regulatory phosphoprotein, phospholamban (PLN). Dephosphorylated PLN is an inhibitor of SERCA2a and phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) or calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CAMKII) relieves these inhibitory effects. Recent studies identified additional regulatory proteins, associated with PLN, that control SR Ca-transport. These include the inhibitor-1 (I-1) of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), the small heat shock protein 20 (Hsp20) and the HS-1 associated protein X-1 (HAX1). In addition, the intra-luminal histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) has been shown to interact with both SERCA2a and triadin. Notably, there is physical and direct interaction between these protein players, mediating a fine-cross talk between SR Ca-uptake, storage and release. Importantly, regulation of SR Ca-cycling by the PLN/SERCA interactome does not only impact cardiomyocyte contractility, but also survival and remodeling. Indeed, naturally occurring variants in these Ca-cycling genes modulate their activity and interactions with other protein partners, resulting in depressed contractility and accelerated remodeling. These genetic variants may serve as potential prognostic or diagnostic markers in cardiac pathophysiology.",
    "Phospholamban interacts with HAX-1, a mitochondrial protein with anti-apoptotic function. Phospholamban (PLN) is a key regulator of Ca(2+) homeostasis and contractility in the heart. Its regulatory effects are mediated through its interaction with the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, (SERCA2a), resulting in alterations of its Ca(2+)-affinity. To identify additional proteins that may interact with PLN, we used the yeast-two-hybrid system to screen an adult human cardiac cDNA library. HS-1 associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) was identified as a PLN-binding partner. The minimal binding regions were mapped to amino acid residues 203-245 for HAX-1 and residues 16-22 for PLN. The interaction between the two proteins was confirmed using GST-HAX-1, bound to the glutathione-matrix, which specifically adsorbed native PLN from human or mouse cardiac homogenates, while in reciprocal binding studies, recombinant His-HAX-1 bound GST-PLN. Kinetic studies using surface plasmon resonance yielded a K(D) of approximately 1 muM as the binding affinity for the PLN/HAX-1 complex. Phosphorylation of PLN by cAMP-dependent protein kinase reduced binding to HAX-1, while increasing concentrations of Ca(2+) diminished the PLN/HAX-1 interaction in a dose-dependent manner. HAX-1 concentrated to mitochondria, but upon transient co-transfection of HEK 293 cells with PLN, HAX-1 redistributed and co-localized with PLN at the endoplasmic reticulum. Analysis of the anti-apoptotic function of HAX-1 revealed that the presence of PLN enhanced the HAX-1 protective effects from hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cell death. These findings suggest a possible link between the Ca(2+) handling by the sarcoplasmic reticulum and cell survival mediated by the PLN/HAX-1 interaction.",
    "Positive and negative selection in murine ultraconserved noncoding elements. There are many more selectively constrained noncoding than coding nucleotides in the mammalian genome, but most mammalian noncoding DNA is subject to weak selection, on average. One of the most striking discoveries to have emerged from comparisons among mammalian genomes is the hundreds of noncoding elements of more than 200 bp in length that show absolute conservation among mammalian orders. These elements represent the tip of the iceberg of a much larger class of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs). Much evidence suggests that CNEs are selectively constrained and not mutational cold-spots, and there is evidence that some CNEs play a role in the regulation of development. Here, we quantify negative and positive selection acting in murine CNEs by analyzing within-species nucleotide variation and between-species divergence of CNEs that we identified using a phylogenetically independent comparison. The distribution of fitness effects of new mutations in CNEs, inferred from within-species polymorphism, suggests that CNEs receive a higher number of strongly selected deleterious mutations and many fewer nearly neutral mutations than amino acid sites of protein-coding genes or regulatory elements close to genes. However, we also show that CNEs experience a far higher proportion of adaptive substitutions than any known category of genomic sites in murids. The absolute rate of adaptation of CNEs is similar to that of amino acid sites of proteins. This result suggests that there is widespread adaptation in mammalian conserved noncoding DNA elements, some of which have been implicated in the regulation of crucially important processes, including development.",
    "Post-surgical outcome for epilepsy associated with type I focal cortical dysplasia subtypes. Focal cortical dysplasias are a well-recognized cause of medically intractable seizures. The clinical relevance of certain subgroups of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification scheme remains to be determined. The aim of the present work is to assess the effect of the focal cortical dysplasia type Ib and Ic histologic subtypes on surgical outcome with respect to seizure frequency. This study also provides an opportunity to compare the predictive value of the ILAE and Palmini et al classification schemes with regard to the type I focal cortical dysplasias. We retrospectively reviewed 91 focal cortical dysplasia patients (55% female; median age: 19 years (interquartile range 8-34); median seizure duration: 108 months (interquartile range 36-204)) with chronic epilepsy who underwent surgery. We compared the pathological subtypes, evaluating the patients' post-surgical outcome with respect to seizure frequency according to the Engel's classification and the ILAE outcome classification. Both the ILAE classification scheme and Palmini et al classification scheme were utilized to classify the histologic subtype. Using \u03c7(2) and Fisher's exact tests, we compared the post-surgical outcomes among these groups. Of the 91 patients, there were 50 patients with ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type Ib, 41 with ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type Ic, 63 with Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type IA, and 28 with Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type IB. After surgery, 44 patients (48%) were seizure-free. Crude analysis revealed no significant difference between patients with subtypes of ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type I or Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type I concerning postoperative outcome according to the Engel and ILAE scoring systems on seizure frequency. Our findings revealed no significant difference concerning surgical outcome with respect to seizure frequency for the histologic subtypes of ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type I (Ib vs Ic) or Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type I (IA vs IB). In isolation, the histologic subtype of focal cortical dysplasia type I does not appear predictive of postoperative outcome.",
    "Potent antitumor activity of the novel HSP90 inhibitors AUY922 and HSP990 in neuroendocrine carcinoid cells. The heat shock protein (HSP) 90 chaperone machine involved in numerous oncogenic signaling pathways is overexpressed in cancer cells and is currently being evaluated for anticancer therapy. Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) system comprise a heterogeneous group of tumors with increasing incidence and poor prognosis. Here, we report the antiproliferative effects of the HSP90 inhibitors AUY922 and HSP990 in neuroendocrine tumor cells. Treatment of human pancreatic BON1, bronchopulmonary NCI-H727 and midgut carcinoid GOT1 neuroendocrine tumor cells with increasing concentrations of AUY922 and HSP990 dose-dependently suppressed cell viability. Significant effects on neuroendocrine cell viability were observed with inhibitor concentrations as low as 5 nM. Inhibition of cell viability was associated with the induction of apoptosis as demonstrated by an increase in sub-G1 events and PARP cleavage. HSP90 inhibition was associated with decreased neuroendocrine ErbB and IGF-I receptor expression, decreased Erk and Akt phospho-rylation and the induction of HSP70 expression. These findings provide evidence that targeted inhibition of upregulated HSP90 activity could be useful for the treatment of aggressive neuroendocrine tumors resistant to conventional therapy.",
    "Preclinical assessment of Orteronel(\u00ae), a CYP17A1 enzyme inhibitor in rats. Orteronel (TAK-700) is a novel and selective inhibitor of CYP17A1, which is expressed in testicular, adrenal and prostate tumor tissues. Orteronel is currently in Phase-III clinical development for metastatic castration-resistant prostate patients. The objective of the study is to assess the permeability, metabolic stability (in various preclinical and human liver microsomes), identify the major CYPs involved in the metabolism of Orteronel. We have also studied the pharmacokinetics and excretion of Orteronel in Sprague-Dawley rats. Orteronel was found to be stable in various liver microsomes tested. The half-life (t \u00bd) of Orteronel with intravenous (i.v.) route was found to be 1.65 \u00b1 0.22 h. The clearance and volume of distribution by i.v. route for Orteronel were found to be 27.5 \u00b1 3.09 mL/min/kg and 3.94 \u00b1 0.85 L/kg, respectively. The absorption of Orteronel was rapid, with maximum concentrations of drug in plasma of 614 \u00b1 76.4, 1,764 \u00b1 166, 4,652 \u00b1 300 and 17,518 \u00b1 3,178 ng/mL attained at 0.38, 0.75, 0.50 and 0.83 h, respectively, after oral administration of Orteronel at 5, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg as a suspension. In the dose proportional oral pharmacokinetic study, the mean t \u00bd by oral route was found to be ~3.5 h and bioavailability ranged between 69 and 89 %. The primary route of elimination for Orteronel is urine.",
    "Prediction of novel microRNA genes in cancer-associated genomic regions--a combined computational and experimental approach. The majority of existing computational tools rely on sequence homology and/or structural similarity to identify novel microRNA (miRNA) genes. Recently supervised algorithms are utilized to address this problem, taking into account sequence, structure and comparative genomics information. In most of these studies miRNA gene predictions are rarely supported by experimental evidence and prediction accuracy remains uncertain. In this work we present a new computational tool (SSCprofiler) utilizing a probabilistic method based on Profile Hidden Markov Models to predict novel miRNA precursors. Via the simultaneous integration of biological features such as sequence, structure and conservation, SSCprofiler achieves a performance accuracy of 88.95% sensitivity and 84.16% specificity on a large set of human miRNA genes. The trained classifier is used to identify novel miRNA gene candidates located within cancer-associated genomic regions and rank the resulting predictions using expression information from a full genome tiling array. Finally, four of the top scoring predictions are verified experimentally using northern blot analysis. Our work combines both analytical and experimental techniques to show that SSCprofiler is a highly accurate tool which can be used to identify novel miRNA gene candidates in the human genome.

    "Pregabalin: a review of its use in fibromyalgia. Oral pregabalin, a calcium channel alpha(2)delta-subunit ligand with analgesic, anxiolytic and antiepileptic activity, has shown efficacy in the treatment of fibromyalgia. It has a multidimensional effect in the treatment of this complex condition, and is associated with rapid and clinically significant improvements in several outcome measures relating to core symptoms of the syndrome, including pain and sleep, in patients with long-standing fibromyalgia. Pregabalin treatment is also associated with improvements in the overall health status of these patients. The beneficial effects of pregabalin are durable in patients with an initial response to the drug. The most common adverse events associated with the drug are dizziness and somnolence, which are generally mild to moderate in intensity and are tolerated by many patients. Pregabalin is, therefore, a valuable option in the first-line treatment of patients with fibromyalgia.",
    "Pregnancy outcome after oocyte donation in patients with Turner's syndrome: Clinical experience and management. Turner's syndrome (TS) is a chromosomal defect with partial or total absence of the X chromosome. Our objective is to report our experience in Greece with patients suffering from TS and trying to conceive; therefore, we present four patients with TS, who underwent In vitro fertilization (ICSI) with donor oocytes in order to get pregnant. Three out of four patients managed to conceive and bring pregnancy to completion. It was shown that patients diagnosed in childhood or adolescence with TS have the possibility to undergo hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and thus, secondary sexual characteristics as well as uterus of almost normal size can develop. Assisted reproduction techniques (ART), predominantly with donated oocytes, could give these patients the possibility to have children.",
    "Pregnancy, delivery, and outcome for the child in maternal epilepsy. PURPOSE: To investigate pregnancy, delivery, and child outcome in an unselected population of women with both treated and untreated epilepsy. METHODS: In the compulsory Medical Birth Registry of Norway, all 2,861 deliveries by women with epilepsy recorded from 1999-2005 were compared to all 369,267 nonepilepsy deliveries in the same period. RESULTS: The majority (66%, n = 1900) in the epilepsy group did not use antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) during pregnancy. A total of 961 epilepsy-pregnancies were exposed to AEDs. Compared to nonepilepsy controls, AED-exposed infants were more often preterm (p = 0.01), and more often had birth weight <2,500 g (p < 0.001), head circumference <2.5 percentile (p < 0.001), and low Apgar score (p = 0.03). Small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants (<10 percentile) occurred more frequently in both AED-exposed (p = 0.05) and unexposed (p = 0.02) epilepsy-pregnancies. Frequency of major congenital malformations (MCMs) was 2.8% (n = 81) in the epilepsy group versus 2.5% in controls (p = 0.3). Increased risk for MCMs could be demonstrated only for exposure to valproate (5.6%, p = 0.005) and AED polytherapy (6.1%, p = 0.02). Neonatal spina bifida was not significantly increased, but was a major indication for elective pregnancy termination among women with epilepsy. Cesarean section was performed more often in maternal epilepsy, regardless of AED-exposure (p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: Adverse pregnancy and birth outcome in women with epilepsy is mainly confined to AED-exposed pregnancies, although some risks are associated also with untreated epilepsy. The risk for congenital malformations was lower than previously reported. This could be due to a shift in AED selection, folic acid supplement, or possibly reflect the true risks in an unselected epilepsy population.",
    "Prevention of JNK phosphorylation as a mechanism for rosiglitazone in neuroprotection after transient cerebral ischemia: activation of dual specificity phosphatase. Rosiglitazone, a synthetic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) agonist, prevents cell death after cerebral ischemia in animal models, but the underlying mechanism has not been clarified. In this study, we examined how rosiglitazone protects neurons against ischemia. Mice treated with rosiglitazone were subjected to 60 minutes of focal ischemia followed by reperfusion. Rosiglitazone reduced infarct volume after ischemia and reperfusion. We show that this neuroprotective effect was reversed with a PPAR\u03b3 antagonist. Western blot analysis showed a significant increase in expression of phosphorylated stress-activated protein kinases (c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38) in ischemic brain tissue. Rosiglitazone blocked this increase. Furthermore, we observed that rosiglitazone increased expression of the dual-specificity phosphatase 8 (DUSP8) protein and messenger RNA in ischemic brain tissue. Dual-specificity phosphatase 8 is a mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase that can dephosphorylate JNK and p38. Another key finding of the present study was that knockdown of DUSP8 in primary cultured cortical neurons that were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation diminished rosiglitazone's effect on downregulation of JNK phosphorylation. Thus, rosiglitazone's neuroprotective effect after ischemia is mediated by blocking JNK phosphorylation induced by ischemia via DUSP8 upregulation.",
    "Primary cilia and signaling pathways in mammalian development, health and disease. Although first described as early as 1898 and long considered a vestigial organelle of little functional importance, the primary cilium has become one of the hottest research topics in modern cell biology and physiology. Primary cilia are nonmotile sensory organelles present in a single copy on the surface of most growth-arrested or differentiated mammalian cells, and defects in their assembly or function are tightly coupled to many developmental defects, diseases and disorders. In normal tissues, the primary cilium coordinates a series of signal transduction pathways, including Hedgehog, Wnt, PDGFRalpha and integrin signaling. In the kidney, the primary cilium may function as a mechano-, chemo- and osmosensing unit that probes the extracellular environment and transmits signals to the cell via, e.g., polycystins, which depend on ciliary localization for appropriate function. Indeed, hypomorphic mutations in the mouse ift88 (previously called Tg737) gene, which encodes a ciliogenic intraflagellar transport protein, result in malformation of primary cilia, and in the collecting ducts of kidney tubules this is accompanied by development of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (PKD). While PKD was one of the first diseases to be linked to dysfunctional primary cilia, defects in this organelle have subsequently been associated with many other phenotypes, including cancer, obesity, diabetes as well as a number of developmental defects. Collectively, these disorders of the cilium are now referred to as the ciliopathies. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the structure and function of primary cilia and some of their roles in coordinating signal transduction pathways in mammalian development, health and disease.",
    "Primary cutaneous pre-B lymphoblastic lymphoma immunohistologically mimics Ewing's sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor. Precursor B-cell lymphoblastic lymphomas (B-LBLs) are rare and most often involve the skin in the head and neck region. Histologically, cutaneous B-LBLs may be confused with other small round-cell neoplasms. Moreover, half of B-LBL patients are negative for CD45 (leucocyte common antigen, LCA), a widely used marker for the diagnosis of lymphoma, and a significant portion express CD99, a marker for Ewing's sarcoma (ES) or primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). Therefore, an extranodal B-LBL may be misinterpreted as PNET or ES. Here, we report on 2 boys, aged 10 and 5 years, with primary cutaneous B-LBL of the scalp. PNET was initially misdiagnosed because the tumor cells were negative for CD45 but strongly positive for CD99. Advanced stage of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) developed later and both patients died during the course of treatment for ALL. In retrospective analyses, tumor cells in the initial biopsy specimens of both patients were found to be reactive to terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), CD43 and CD10. Thus, the diagnosis of B-LBL was confirmed. These cases illustrate the possibility that primary cutaneous B-LBL may mimic ES or PNET immunophenotypically, and that correct diagnosis in doubtful cases may be facilitated by analysis using a complete panel of antibodies, particularly including TdT and CD43.",
    "Primary microRNA processing is functionally coupled to RNAP II transcription in vitro. Previous studies in vivo reported that processing of primary microRNA (pri-miRNA) is coupled to transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) and can occur co-transcriptionally. Here we have established a robust in vivo system in which pri-miRNA is transcribed by RNAP II and processed to pre-miRNA in HeLa cell nuclear extracts. We show that both the kinetics and efficiency of pri-miRNA processing are dramatically enhanced in this system compared to that of the corresponding naked pri-miRNA. Moreover, this enhancement is general as it occurs with multiple pri-miRNAs. We also show that nascent pri-miRNA is efficiently processed before it is released from the DNA template. Together, our work directly demonstrates that transcription and pri-miRNA processing are functionally coupled and establishes the first in vivo model systems for this functional coupling and for co-transcriptional processing.",
    "Processive selenocysteine incorporation during synthesis of eukaryotic selenoproteins. Selenoproteins are a family of proteins that share the common feature of containing selenocysteine, the \"twenty-first\" amino acid. Selenocysteine incorporation occurs during translation of selenoprotein messages by redefinition of UGA codons, which normally specify termination of translation. Studies of the eukaryotic selenocysteine incorporation mechanism suggest that selenocysteine insertion is inefficient compared with termination. Nevertheless, selenoprotein P and several other selenoproteins are known to contain multiple selenocysteines. The production of full-length (FL) protein from these messages would seem to demand highly efficient selenocysteine incorporation due to the compounding effect of termination at each UGA codon. We present data demonstrating that efficient incorporation of multiple selenocysteines can be reconstituted in rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation reactions. Selenocysteine incorporation at the first UGA codon is inefficient but increases by approximately 10-fold at subsequent downstream UGA codons. We found that ribosomes in the \"processive\" phase of selenocysteine incorporation (i.e., after decoding the first UGA codon as selenocysteine) are fully competent to terminate translation at UAG and UAA codons, that ribosomes become less efficient at selenocysteine incorporation as the distance between UGA codons is increased, and that efficient selenocysteine incorporation is not dependent on cis-acting elements unique to selenoprotein P. Furthermore, we found that the percentage of ribosomes decoding a UGA codon as selenocysteine rather than termination can be increased by 3- to 5-fold by placing the murine leukemia virus UAG read-through element upstream of the first UGA codon or by providing a competing messenger RNA in trans. The mechanisms of selenocysteine incorporation and selenoprotein synthesis are discussed in light of these results.",
    "Progesterone/RANKL is a major regulatory axis in the human breast. Estrogens and progesterones are major drivers of breast development but also promote carcinogenesis in this organ. Yet, their respective roles and the mechanisms underlying their action in the human breast are unclear. Receptor activator of nuclear factor \u03baB ligand (RANKL) has been identified as a pivotal paracrine mediator of progesterone function in mouse mammary gland development and mammary carcinogenesis. Whether the factor has the same role in humans is of clinical interest because an inhibitor for RANKL, denosumab, is already used for the treatment of bone disease and might benefit breast cancer patients. We show that progesterone receptor (PR) signaling failed to induce RANKL in PR(+) breast cancer cell lines and in dissociated, cultured breast epithelial cells. In clinical specimens from healthy donors and intact breast tissue microstructures, hormone response was maintained and RANKL expression was under progesterone control, which increased RNA stability. RANKL was sufficient to trigger cell proliferation and was required for progesterone-induced proliferation. The findings were validated in vivo where RANKL protein expression in the breast epithelium correlated with serum progesterone levels and the protein was expressed in a subset of luminal cells that express PR. Thus, important hormonal control mechanisms are conserved across species, making RANKL a potential target in breast cancer treatment and prevention.",
    "Prognostic performance of MR-pro-adrenomedullin in patients with community acquired pneumonia in the Emergency Department compared to clinical severity scores PSI and CURB. AIM: (i) evaluate the performance of MR-pro-ADM in reflecting the outcome and risk for CAP patients in the emergency department, and (ii) compare the prognostic performance of MR-pro-ADM with that of clinical scores PSI and CURB65. METHODS: Observational prospective, single-center study in patients with suspected community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Eighty one patients underwent full clinical and laboratory assessment as by protocol, and were followed up a 28 days. Primary endpoints measured were: death, death at 14 days, non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV), endotracheal intubation (EI), ICU admission, overall hospital stay >10 days, emergency department stay >4 days. The discriminative performance of MR-pro-ADM and clinical scores was assessed by AUROC analysis. RESULTS: The distribution for MR-pro-ADM followed an upward trend, increasing with the increase of both PSI (p<0.001) and CURB65 (p<0.001) classes. However, the difference between MRproADM values and score classes was significant only in the case of CURB65 classes 0 and 1 (p = 0.046), 2 (p = 0.013), and 3 (p = 0.011); and with PSI classes 5, 3 (p = 0.044), and 1 (p = 0.020). As to the differences among variables for the six end-points, MR-pro-ADM values in the two groups selected for each considered end-point differed in a statistically significant manner for all endpoints. Both PSI and CURB65 differed significantly for all end-points, except for stay in the ED longer than 4 days and the hospital stay longer than 10 days and endotracheal intubation (only PSI classes differed with statistical significance). ROC analyses evidenced that MR-pro-ADM values gave the greatest AUC for the prediction of death, endotracheal intubation, hospital stay >10 days and DE stay >4 days, compared to the PSI and CURB (though difference not statistically significant). For each endpoint measured, the best thresholds values for Mr-pro-ADM were: 1.6 (specificity 76.5%; sensitivity 77.8%) for death; 2.5 (specificity 88.9%; sensitivity 80.0%) for death at 14 days; 1.5 (specificity 77.0%; sensitivity 87.5%) for NIMV; 2.4 (specificity 88.7%; sensitivity 83.3%) for endotracheal intubation; 0.9 (specificity 53.5%; sensitivity 70.6%) for DE stay greater than 4 days; 1.9 (specificity 82.1%; sensitivity 55.3%) for hospital stay greater than 10 days. The AUC for the combination of MR-pro-ADM and PSI was 81.29% [63.41%-99.17%], but not in a statistically significant manner compared to the AUCs of the single predictors. Conversely, the AUC for the combination of MR-pro-ADM and CURB65 was 87.58% [75.54%-99.62%], which was significantly greater than the AUC of CURB65 (p = 0.047) or PSI (p = 0.017) alone. CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirms that assessment of MR-pro-ADM levels in CAP patients in addition to CURB scores increases the prognostic accuracy of CURB alone and may help rule out discrepancies arising from flawed clinical severity classification. With particular reference to patients scoring in the upper classes of CURB and PSI, MR-pro-ADM values provided additional information towards a better risk stratification of those patients. In particular, our results pointed towards two MR-pro-ADM threshold values that appear to predict with a good degree of accuracy the patient's need for non-invasive mechanical ventilation, endotracheal intubation, or intensive care. This aspect, however, deserves further investigation.",
    "Proteasome inhibitors - molecular basis and current perspectives in multiple myeloma. Inhibition of proteasome, a proteolytic complex responsible for the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, has emerged as a powerful strategy for treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), a plasma cell malignancy. First-in-class agent, bortezomib, has demonstrated great positive therapeutic efficacy in MM, both in pre-clinical and in clinical studies. However, despite its high efficiency, a large proportion of patients do not achieve sufficient clinical response. Therefore, the development of a second-generation of proteasome inhibitors (PIs) with improved pharmacological properties was needed. Recently, several of these new agents have been introduced into clinics including carfilzomib, marizomib and ixazomib. Further, new orally administered second-generation PI oprozomib is being investigated. This review provides an overview of main mechanisms of action of PIs in MM, focusing on the ongoing development and progress of novel anti-proteasome therapeutics.",
    "Proteasome inhibitors. Proteasome inhibitors have a 20 year history in cancer therapy. The first proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib (Velcade, PS-341), a break-through multiple myeloma treatment, moved rapidly through development from bench in 1994 to first approval in 2003. Bortezomib is a reversible boronic acid inhibitor of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome. Next generation proteasome inhibitors include carfilzomib and oprozomib which are irreversible epoxyketone proteasome inhibitors; and ixazomib and delanzomib which are reversible boronic acid proteasome inhibitors. Two proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib and carfilzomib are FDA approved drugs and ixazomib and oprozomib are in late stage clinical trials. All of the agents are potent cytotoxics. The disease focus for all the proteasome inhibitors is multiple myeloma. This focus arose from clinical observations made in bortezomib early clinical trials. Later preclinical studies confirmed that multiple myeloma cells were indeed more sensitive to proteasome inhibitors than other tumor cell types. The discovery and development of the proteasome inhibitor class of anticancer agents has progressed through a classic route of serendipity and scientific investigation. These agents are continuing to have a major impact in their treatment of hematologic malignancies and are beginning to be explored as potential treatment agent for non-cancer indications.",
    "Protection conferred by recombinant Yersinia pestis antigens produced by a rapid and highly scalable plant expression system. Plague is still an endemic disease in different regions of the world. Increasing reports of incidence, the discovery of antibiotic resistance strains, and concern about a potential use of the causative bacteria Yersinia pestis as an agent of biological warfare have highlighted the need for a safe, efficacious, and rapidly producible vaccine. The use of F1 and V antigens and the derived protein fusion F1-V has shown great potential as a protective vaccine in animal studies. Plants have been extensively studied for the production of pharmaceutical proteins as an inexpensive and scalable alternative to common expression systems. In the current study the recombinant plague antigens F1, V, and fusion protein F1-V were produced by transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana by using a deconstructed tobacco mosaic virus-based system that allowed very rapid and extremely high levels of expression. All of the plant-derived purified antigens, administered s.c. to guinea pigs, generated systemic immune responses and provided protection against an aerosol challenge of virulent Y. pestis.",
    "Proteomic analysis of the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome. Identification of protein components in the 28 S small subunit. The mammalian mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome) has a highly protein-rich composition with a small sedimentation coefficient of 55 S, consisting of 39 S large and 28 S small subunits. In the previous study, we analyzed 39 S large subunit proteins from bovine mitoribosome (Suzuki, T., Terasaki, M., Takemoto-Hori, C., Hanada, T., Ueda, T., Wada, A., and Watanabe, K. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 21724-21736). The results suggested structural compensation for the rRNA deficit through proteins of increased molecular mass in the mitoribosome. We report here the identification of 28 S small subunit proteins. Each protein was separated by radical-free high-reducing two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry using electrospray ionization/ion trap mass spectrometer to identify cDNA sequence by expressed sequence tag data base searches in silico. Twenty one proteins from the small subunit were identified, including 11 new proteins along with their complete cDNA sequences from human and mouse. In addition to these proteins, three new proteins were also identified in the 55 S mitoribosome. We have clearly identified a mitochondrial homologue of S12, which is a key regulatory protein of translation fidelity and a candidate for the autosomal dominant deafness gene, DFNA4. The apoptosis-related protein DAP3 was found to be a component of the small subunit, indicating a new function for the mitoribosome in programmed cell death. In summary, we have mapped a total of 55 proteins from the 55 S mitoribosome on the two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels.",
    "Pse-in-One: a web server for generating various modes of pseudo components of DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. With the avalanche of biological sequences generated in the post-genomic age, one of the most challenging problems in computational biology is how to effectively formulate the sequence of a biological sample (such as DNA, RNA or protein) with a discrete model or a vector that can effectively reflect its sequence pattern information or capture its key features concerned. Although several web servers and stand-alone tools were developed to address this problem, all these tools, however, can only handle one type of samples. Furthermore, the number of their built-in properties is limited, and hence it is often difficult for users to formulate the biological sequences according to their desired features or properties. In this article, with a much larger number of built-in properties, we are to propose a much more flexible web server called Pse-in-One (http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/Pse-in-One/), which can, through its 28 different modes, generate nearly all the possible feature vectors for DNA, RNA and protein sequences. Particularly, it can also generate those feature vectors with the properties defined by users themselves. These feature vectors can be easily combined with machine-learning algorithms to develop computational predictors and analysis methods for various tasks in bioinformatics and system biology. It is anticipated that the Pse-in-One web server will become a very useful tool in computational proteomics, genomics, as well as biological sequence analysis. Moreover, to maximize users' convenience, its stand-alone version can also be downloaded from http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/Pse-in-One/download/, and directly run on Windows, Linux, Unix and Mac OS.",
    "Psoriasin (S100A7) increases the expression of ROS and VEGF and acts through RAGE to promote endothelial cell proliferation. Psoriasin (S100A7), originally identified in psoriasis, is a calcium-binding protein belonging to the multigenic S100 family. In high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ, psoriasin was identified as one of the most abundant transcripts. We have previously shown that psoriasin was induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, the downregulation of psoriasin by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) led to the reduced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether psoriasin could have direct effects on endothelial cells. In this study we demonstrated that psoriasin increased VEGF expression in mammary epithelial cells. The treatment of endothelial cells with recombinant psoriasin increased proliferation comparable to that of recombinant VEGF protein. No change in proliferation was seen when endothelial cells were infected with psoriasin-expressing adenoviruses, suggesting that the proliferative effect of psoriasin was mediated by a specific receptor. Treatment with sRAGE, targeting the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), thus inhibited endothelial cell proliferation and tube formation enhanced by recombinant psoriasin. We showed that VEGF expression was not induced by hydrogen peroxide, when psoriasin was silenced by shRNA, which led to the hypothesis that psoriasin induces ROS. Indeed, psoriasin was shown to induce ROS in both endothelial and epithelial cells. Moreover, sRAGE inhibited the psoriasin-dependent generation of ROS in endothelial cells. Finally, treatment with antioxidant Bcl-2 protein abolished the effect of psoriasin on endothelial cell proliferation. Our data suggest that psoriasin expression in mammary epithelial cells leads to increased endothelial cell proliferation in a paracrine manner through RAGE. Psoriasin may therefore play a role in breast cancer progression by promoting oxidative stress response and angiogenesis.",
    "Psoriasis and comorbid diseases: Implications for management. As summarized in the first article in this continuing medical education series, the currently available epidemiologic data suggest that psoriasis may be a risk factor for cardiometabolic disease. Emerging data also suggest associations between psoriasis and other comorbidities beyond psoriatic arthritis, including chronic kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease, hepatic disease, certain malignancies, infections, and mood disorders. Recognizing the comorbid disease burden of psoriasis is essential for ensuring comprehensive care of patients with psoriasis. The clinical implications of the comorbid diseases that\u00a0are associated with psoriasis and recommendations for clinical management are reviewed in this article.",
    "Quality comparison of umbilical cord blood cryopreserved with conventional versus automated systems. Umbilical cord blood (CB) banks usually freeze and store CB for clinical transplantation using conventional controlled-rate freezer or the automated BioArchive system. The aim of this study is to compare the quality of CB cryopreserved with conventional and automated methods and to make clear the cause of the quality difference between the two methods. The experiment used 80\u00a0CB units: 40 were conventionally cryopreserved and the remainder were cryopreserved with a BioArchive. After thawing, the following measures of CB quality were compared: recovery rates of cell count, cell viability of total nucleated cells (TNCs), mononuclear cells (MNCs), and CD34+ cells, as well as colony-forming unit-granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) content. Additionally, processing and storage records were reviewed to quantify the number of exposures of CB units at room temperature (transient warming event, TWE), which was analyzed in relation to CB quality. MNC and CD34+ cell viability were as follows: MNC, 78.2%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.8% (conventional), 81.7%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.2% (automated); CD34+ cell, 90.6%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.9% (conventional), 94.7%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.5% (automated). The absolute CFU-GM content per CB unit was 7.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 with conventional cryopreservation and 12.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 with automated cryopreservation. CBs cryopreserved with BioArchive showed significantly higher MNC and CD34+ cell viability, and CFU-GM content than those conventionally cryopreserved. The CB quality comparison depending on the amount of TWEs showed no significant quality difference between groups that were more exposed to TWEs and groups that were less exposed. CBs cryopreserved with BioArchive were of higher quality than conventionally cryopreserved CBs, and the cause of quality difference might be due to the difference of freezing conditions rather than the TWE effect.",
    "Quantification of metabolites for assessing human exposure to soapberry toxins hypoglycin A and methylenecyclopropylglycine. Ingestion of soapberry fruit toxins hypoglycin A and methylenecyclopropylglycine has been linked to public health challenges worldwide. In 1976, over 100 years after Jamaican vomiting sickness (JVS) was first reported, the cause of JVS was linked to the ingestion of the toxin hypoglycin A produced by ackee fruit. A structural analogue of hypoglycin A, methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPG), was implicated as the cause of an acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). Much of the evidence linking hypoglycin A and MCPG to these diseases has been largely circumstantial due to the lack of an analytical method for specific metabolites. This study presents an analytical approach to identify and quantify specific urine metabolites for exposure to hypoglycin A and MCPG. The metabolites are excreted in urine as glycine adducts methylenecyclopropylacetyl-glycine (MCPA-Gly) and methylenecyclopropylformyl-glycine (MCPF-Gly). These metabolites were processed by isotope dilution, separated by reverse-phase liquid chromatography, and monitored by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The analytical response ratio was linearly proportional to the concentration of MCPF-Gly and MCPA-Gly in urine from 0.10 to 20 \u03bcg/mL with a correlation coefficient of r > 0.99. The assay demonstrated accuracy > 80% and precision < 20% RSD across the calibration range. This method has been applied to assess exposure to hypoglycin A and MCPG as part of a larger public health initiative and was used to provide the first reported identification of MCPF-Gly and MCPA-Gly in human urine.",
    "Quantification of suvorexant in urine using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Suvorexant (Belsomra) is a novel sedative hypnotic drug that is prescribed to promote sleep in patients with insomnia. It is the first of a new class of drugs classified as dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs). Sedative hypnotics with central nervous system depressant effects feature prominently in forensic toxicology investigations. For this reason, a new analytical method was developed to identify suvorexant in urine using liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Due to the absence of a commercially available isotopically labeled internal standard, estazolam-D5 was used due to its azepine, triazole and chlorinated functionality. The limit of detection and limit of quantitation was 10ng/mL and the linear range of the assay was 10-1000ng/mL. Accuracy and precision (%CV) were 98-101% and <11% at 30, 250 and 800ng/mL. Interferences from matrix and fifty common drugs were not present and processed samples were stable for 24h at room temperature. Suvorexant is a new drug of significant forensic interest due to its hypnotic and central nervous system depressant effects. The absence of commercially available metabolites and its chromatographic properties present some challenges in terms of identification. Nevertheless, a robust, reliable and sensitive assay was developed to identify suvorexant using GC/MS analysis.",
    "Quantitative Profiling of the Effects of Vanoxerine on Human Cardiac Ion Channels and its Application to Cardiac Risk. Vanoxerine has been in clinical trials for Parkinsonism, depression and cocaine addiction but lacked efficacy. Although a potent blocker of hERG, it produced no serious adverse events. We attributed the unexpected result to offsetting Multiple Ion Channel Effects (MICE). Vanoxerine's effects were strongly frequency-dependent and we repositioned it for treatment of atrial fibrillation and flutter. Vanoxerine terminated AF/AFL in an animal model and a dose-ranging clinical trial. Reversion to normal rhythm was associated with QT prolongation yet absent proarrhythmia markers for Torsade de Pointes (TdP). To understand the QT/TdP discordance, we used quantitative profiling and compared vanoxerine with dofetilide, a selective hERG-blocking torsadogen used for intractable AF, verapamil, a non-torsadogenic MICE comparator and bepridil, a torsadogenic MICE comparator. At clinically relevant concentrations, verapamil blocked hCav1.2 and hERG, as did vanoxerine and bepridil both of which also blocked hNav1.5. In acute experiments and simulations, dofetilide produced early after depolarizations (EADs) and arrhythmias, whereas verapamil, vanoxerine and bepridil produced no proarrhythmia markers. Of the MICE drugs only bepridil inhibited hERG trafficking following overnight exposure. The results are consistent with the emphasis on MICE of the CiPA assay. Additionally we propose that trafficking inhibition of hERG be added to CiPA.",

    "RET proto-oncogene genetic screening of families with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 optimizes diagnostic and clinical management in China. BACKGROUND: Genetic screening for germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene has been extensively exploited worldwide to optimize the diagnostic and clinical management of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) patients and their relatives. However, a distinct lag period exists not only in the recognition but also in the medical treatment of patients with MEN2. Here we present a comprehensive genetic and clinical analysis of MEN2 among Chinese families followed from 1975 to 2011. Our series comprises 36 index cases and 134 relatives from 11 independent families. METHODS: Genetic diagnosis was performed in all participants by direct sequencing all relevant RET exons. Thyroidectomy was performed in 50 patients with varying cervical neck dissection procedures. Patients with pheochromocytoma (PHEO) underwent specific surgery. Demographic, clinical profiles, mutation types, tumor histopathologic features, and follow-up records were systematically analyzed. RESULTS: The RET mutations p.C634Y (n=34), p.C634R (n=6), p.C618S (n=13), p.V292M/R67H/R982C (n=7), p.L790F (n=2), and p.C634Y/V292M/R67H/R982C (n=1) were confirmed in 31 index cases and then identified in 32 at-risk relatives (mutation carriers), with MEN2A as the most common clinical subtype. The overall penetrance of PHEO in patients with MEN2A was 46.7%. A total of 50 patients underwent thyroidectomy, and there was a significant lowering of their mean age at thyroidectomy and the tumor diameter of the mutation carriers that were detected and operated on compared with the index cases (age at first surgery: 29.3 vs. 39.3 years, p<0.05; maximum size: 1.1 vs. 3.3 cm, p<0.001). There was also a decrease in the TNM staging and the proportion of patients who underwent inappropriate initial thyroid surgery (pN1: 31.6% vs. 100%, p<0.001; inappropriate surgery: 0% vs. 29%). Meanwhile, disease-free survival (DFS) increased (DFS: 100% vs. 58.1%, p<0.05). Both medullary thyroid carcinoma-specific (n=1) and PHEO-specific (n=5) deaths were reported during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Our results further substantiate that gene scanning of all relevant RET exons is a powerful tool in the management of MEN2 patients, especially in asymptomatic carriers, and has led to earlier diagnosis and more complete initial treatment of patients with MEN2 in China.",
    "RNA editing in Drosophila melanogaster: New targets and functional consequences. Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA [adenosine deaminase, RNA specific (ADAR)] catalyze the site-specific conversion of adenosine to inosine in primary mRNA transcripts. These re-coding events affect coding potential, splice sites, and stability of mature mRNAs. ADAR is an essential gene, and studies in mouse, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila suggest that its primary function is to modify adult behavior by altering signaling components in the nervous system. By comparing the sequence of isogenic cDNAs to genomic DNA, we have identified and experimentally verified 27 new targets of Drosophila ADAR. Our analyses led us to identify new classes of genes whose transcripts are targets of ADAR, including components of the actin cytoskeleton and genes involved in ion homeostasis and signal transduction. Our results indicate that editing in Drosophila increases the diversity of the proteome, and does so in a manner that has direct functional consequences on protein function.",
    "RNAi therapy targeting KRAS in combination with chemotherapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients. PURPOSE: The miniature biodegradable implant siG12D-LODER\u2122 was inserted into a tumor and released a siRNA drug against KRAS(G12D) along four months. This novel siRNA based drug was studied, in combination with chemotherapy, as targeted therapy for Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer (LAPC). METHODS: An open-label Phase 1/2a study in the first-line setting of patients with non-operable LAPC was initiated. In this study patients were assigned to receive a single dose of siG12D-LODERs, in three escalating dose cohorts (0.025mg, 0.75mg and 3.0mg). Gemcitabine was given on a weekly basis, following the siG12D-LODERTM insertion, until disease progression. The recommended dose was further examined with modified FOLFIRINOX. The follow up period was eight weeks and survival until death. RESULTS: Fifteen patients with LAPC were enrolled. Among the 15 treated patients, the most frequent adverse events observed were grade 1or 2 in severity (89%); five patients experienced serious adverse events (SAEs). In 12 patients analyzed by CT scans, none showed tumor progression, the majority (10/12) demonstrated stable disease and two showed partial response. Decrease in tumor marker CA19-9 was observed in 70% (7/10) of patients. Median overall survival was 15.12 months; 18 month survival was 38.5%. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of siG12D-LODER\u2122 and chemotherapy is well tolerated, safe and demonstrated a potential efficacy in patients with LAPC. NCT01188785.",
    "RNAi-mediated knockdown of Xist can rescue the impaired postimplantation development of cloned mouse embryos. Cloning mammals by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is highly inefficient. Most SCNT-generated embryos die after implantation because of unidentified, complex epigenetic errors in the process of postimplantation embryonic development. Here we identify the most upstream level of dysfunction leading to impaired development of clones by using RNAi against Xist, a gene responsible for X chromosome inactivation (XCI). A prior injection of Xist-specific siRNA into reconstructed oocytes efficiently corrected SCNT-specific aberrant Xist expression at the morula stage, but failed to do so thereafter at the blastocyst stage. However, we found that shortly after implantation, this aberrant XCI status in cloned embryos had been corrected autonomously in both embryonic and extraembryonic tissues, probably through a newly established XCI control for postimplantation embryos. Embryo transfer experiments revealed that siRNA-treated embryos showed 10 times higher survival than controls as early as embryonic day 5.5 and this high survival persisted until term, resulting in a remarkable improvement in cloning efficiency (12% vs. 1% in controls). Importantly, unlike control clones, these Xist-siRNA clones at birth showed only a limited dysregulation of their gene expression, indicating that correction of Xist expression in preimplantation embryos had a long-term effect on their postnatal normality. Thus, contrary to the general assumption, our results suggest that the fate of cloned embryos is determined almost exclusively before implantation by their XCI status. Furthermore, our strategy provides a promising breakthrough for mammalian SCNT cloning, because RNAi treatment of oocytes is readily applicable to most mammal species.",
    "Rag GTPases mediate amino acid-dependent recruitment of TFEB and MITF to lysosomes. The mTORC1 complex supports cell growth and proliferation in response to energy levels, growth factors, and nutrients. The Rag guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) activate mTORC1 in response to amino acids by promoting its redistribution to lysosomes. In this paper, we identify a novel role for Rags in controlling activation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of autophagic and lysosomal gene expression. Interaction of TFEB with active Rag heterodimers promoted recruitment of TFEB to lysosomes, leading to mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation and inhibition of TFEB. The interaction of TFEB with Rags required the first 30 residues of TFEB and the switch regions of the Rags G domain. Depletion or inactivation of Rags prevented recruitment of TFEB to lysosomes, whereas expression of active Rags induced association of TFEB with lysosomal membranes. Finally, Rag GTPases bound and regulated activation of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, suggesting a broader role for Rags in the control of gene expression. Our work provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms that link nutrient availability and TFEB localization and activation.",
    "Recommendations for the management of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy in 2011. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a neuromuscular disease, characterized by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, facial involvement, and selectivity and asymmetry of muscle involvement. In general, FSHD typically presents before age 20 years. Usually, FSHD muscle involvement starts in the face and then progresses to the shoulder girdle, the humeral muscles and the abdominal muscles, and then the anterolateral compartment of the leg. Disease severity is highly variable and progression is very slow. About 20% of FSHD patients become wheelchair-bound. Lifespan is not shortened. The diagnosis of FSHD is based on a genetic test by which a deletion of 3.3kb DNA repeats (named D4Z4 and mapping to the subtelomeric region of chromosome 4q35) is identified. The progressive pattern of FSHD requires that the severity of symptoms as well as their physical, social and psychological impact be evaluated on a regular basis. A yearly assessment is recommended. Multidisciplinary management of FSHD--consisting of a combination of genetic counselling, functional assessment, an assessment by a physical therapist, prescription of symptomatic therapies and prevention of known complications of this disease--is required. Prescription of physical therapy sessions and orthopedic appliances are to be adapted to the patient's deficiencies and contractures.",
    "Reconstitution of an E box-binding Myc:Max complex with recombinant full-length proteins expressed in Escherichia coli. The c-Myc oncoprotein (Myc) is a DNA sequence-specific transcription factor that regulates transcription of a wide variety of genes involved in the control of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis and its deregulated expression is implicated in many types of human cancer. Myc has an N-terminal transcription activation domain (TAD) that interacts with various coactivators and a C-terminal basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) domain required for E box-specific DNA-binding and heterodimerization with its obligatory bHLHZip protein partner Max. The analysis of the mechanisms by which the Myc:Max complex regulates transcription at the molecular level in vitro has been hampered by the difficulty in obtaining highly pure recombinant Myc:Max heterodimers that contain full-length Myc with its complete TAD domain and that have sequence-specific DNA-binding activity. Here, we describe a simple method to reconstitute recombinant Myc:Max complexes from highly purified full-length proteins expressed in Escherichia coli that are soluble and highly active in E box-specific DNA-binding in vitro. The reconstituted Myc:Max complexes are stable and lack Max:Max homodimers. This procedure should facilitate the characterization of the DNA-binding and transcription activation functions of full-length Myc:Max complexes in vitro and in particular the role of Myc TAD-interacting cofactors and Myc:Max post-translational modifications.",
    "Reduced pCREB in Alzheimer's disease prefrontal cortex is reflected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Cyclic-AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) signaling has a critical role in the formation of memories. CREB signaling is dysfunctional in the brains of mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and evidence suggests that CREB signaling may be disrupted in human AD brains as well. Here, we show that both CREB and its activated form pCREB-Ser(133) (pCREB) are reduced in the prefrontal cortex of AD patients. Similarly, the transcription cofactors CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 are reduced in the prefrontal cortex of AD patients, indicating additional dysfunction of CREB signaling in AD. Importantly, we show that pCREB expression is reduced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of AD subjects. In addition, pCREB levels in PBMC positively correlated with pCREB expression in the postmortem brain of persons with AD. These results suggest that pCREB expression in PBMC may be indicative of its expression in the brain, and thus offers the intriguing possibility of pCREB as a biomarker of cognitive function and disease progression in AD.",
    "Reference ranges and determinants of total hCG levels during pregnancy: the Generation R Study. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a pregnancy hormone secreted by the placental synctiotrophoblast cell layer that has been linked to fetal growth and various placental, uterine and fetal functions. In order to investigate the effects of hCG on clinical endpoints, knowledge on reference range (RR) methodology and determinants of gestational hCG levels is crucial. Moreover, a better understanding of gestational hCG physiology can improve current screening programs and future clinical management. Serum total hCG levels were determined in 8195 women participating in the Generation R Study. Gestational age specific RRs using 'ultrasound derived gestational age' (US RRs) were calculated and compared with 'last menstrual period derived gestational age' (LMP RRs) and a model-based RR. We also investigated which pregnancy characteristics were associated with hCG levels. Compared to the US RRs, the LMP RRs were lower, most notably for the median and lower limit levels. No considerable differences were found between RRs calculated in the general population or in uncomplicated pregnancies only. Maternal smoking, BMI, parity, ethnicity, fetal gender, placental weight and hyperemesis gravidarum symptoms were associated with total hCG. We provide gestational RRs for total hCG and show that total hCG values and RR cut-offs during pregnancy vary depending on pregnancy dating methodology. This is likely due to the influence of hCG on embryonic growth, suggesting that ultrasound based pregnancy dating might be less reliable in women with high/low hCG levels. Furthermore, we identify different pregnancy characteristics that influence total hCG levels considerably and should therefore be accounted for in clinical studies.",
    "Regulation of NF-\u03baB by ubiquitination and degradation of the I\u03baBs. The nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway is a busy ground for the action of the ubiquitin-proteasome system; many of the signaling steps are coordinated by protein ubiquitination. The end point of this pathway is to induce transcription, and to this end, there is a need to overcome a major obstacle, a set of inhibitors (I\u03baBs) that bind NF-\u03baB and prohibit either the nuclear entry or the DNA binding of the transcription factor. Two major signaling steps are required for the elimination of the inhibitors: activation of the I\u03baB kinase (IKK) and degradation of the phosphorylated inhibitors. IKK activation and I\u03baB degradation involve different ubiquitination modes; the latter is mediated by a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF(\u03b2-TrCP) . The F-box component of this E3, \u03b2-TrCP, recognizes the I\u03baB degron formed following phosphorylation by IKK and thus couples I\u03baB phosphorylation to ubiquitination. SCF(\u03b2-TrCP) -mediated I\u03baB ubiquitination and degradation is a very efficient process, often resulting in complete degradation of the key inhibitor I\u03baB\u03b1 within a few minutes of cell stimulation. In vivo ablation of \u03b2-TrCP results in accumulation of all the I\u03baBs and complete NF-\u03baB inhibition. As many details of I\u03baB-\u03b2-TrCP interaction have been worked out, the development of \u03b2-TrCP inhibitors might be a feasible therapeutic approach for NF-\u03baB-associated human disease. However, we may still need to advance our understanding of the mechanism of I\u03baB degradation as well as of the diverse functions of \u03b2-TrCP in vivo.",
    "Regulation of the mitochondrial dynamin-like protein Opa1 by proteolytic cleavage. The dynamin-related protein Opa1 is localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it facilitates fusion between mitochondria. Apoptosis causes Opa1 release into the cytosol and causes mitochondria to fragment. Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential also causes mitochondrial fragmentation but not Opa1 release into the cytosol. Both conditions induce the proteolytic cleavage of Opa1, suggesting that mitochondrial fragmentation is triggered by Opa1 inactivation. The opposite effect was observed with knockdown of the mitochondrial intermembrane space protease Yme1. Knockdown of Yme1 prevents the constitutive cleavage of a subset of Opa1 splice variants but does not affect carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone or apoptosis-induced cleavage. Knockdown of Yme1 also increases mitochondrial connectivity, but this effect is independent of Opa1 because it also occurs in Opa1 knockdown cells. We conclude that Yme1 constitutively regulates a subset of Opa1 isoforms and an unknown mitochondrial morphology protein, whereas the loss of membrane potential induces the further proteolysis of Opa1.",
    "Remission of ulcerated necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum after bariatric surgery. A 32-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus suffering from morbid obesity with BMI 45,14 kg/m(2) was operated on. Not only the type 2DM but also one of its complication known as necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum remitted postoperatively. Obesity should no longer be regarded simply as a cosmetic problem affecting certain individuals but an epidemic that threatens global well-being. It causes or exacerbates many health problems, and in particular, it is associated with the type 2 diabetes. Necrobiosis lipoidica is a granulomatous skin disease of unknown etiology, associated mainly with diabetes mellitus. We presented in this paper a morbid obese case of necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum with dramatic good response to bariatric surgery.",
    "Renal Amyloidosis Associated With Kartagener Syndrome in a Dog. A 4-year-old cocker spaniel, male, of 12kg body weight was presented because of the onset of polyuria or polydipsia. From the first months of its life, the dog had exhibited constant serous to mucopurulent nasal discharge, productive cough, sneezing, reverse sneezing, otitis, and recurrent episodes of fever. The respiratory signs had been treated several times with antibiotics, without ever achieving a complete resolution. Clinical examination revealed normal rectal temperature (38.3\u00b0C), increased respiratory rate (40breaths/min), a copious mucous nasal discharge and right deviation of the heart apex beat (ictus cordis). Increased respiratory sounds with moist rales and crackles were found on chest auscultation. An increase in serum creatinine, urea and phosphorus, hypoalbuminemia and proteinuria were found. Lateral and ventrodorsal radiographs of the thorax and of the abdomen showed the transposition of the heart, with the cardiac apex pointing toward the right (dextrocardia), bronchointerstitial lung pattern, areas of consolidation, lesions consistent with bronchiectasis caves and a mirror-image of abdominal organs, confirming the diagnosis of complete situs inversus (CSI). Respiratory signs, combined with CSI, suggested the diagnosis of Kartagener syndrome (KS). Abdominal ultrasound showed an increase in the echogenicity of the renal parenchyma, a loss of definition of the corticomedullary line, slight bilateral pyelectasis, and decreased cortical perfusion. The dog died 2 months later because of a further worsening of the clinical condition. Necroscopy demonstrated the existence of CSI, rhinosinusitis, bronchitis, and bronchiectasis, so confirming the diagnosis of KS, and renal amyloidosis. This is the first case reported in veterinary medicine of the presence of renal amyloidosis together with KS in a dog.",
    "Restoration of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex after exon skipping therapy in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. We previously conducted a proof of principle; dose escalation study in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients using the morpholino splice-switching oligonucleotide AVI-4658 (eteplirsen) that induces skipping of dystrophin exon 51 in patients with relevant deletions, restores the open reading frame and induces dystrophin protein expression after intramuscular (i.m.) injection. We now show that this dystrophin expression was accompanied by an elevated expression of \u03b1-sarcoglycan, \u03b2-dystroglycan (BDG) and--in relevant cases--neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) at the sarcolemma, each of which is a component of a different subcomplex of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (DAPC). As expected, nNOS expression was relocalized to the sarcolemma in Duchenne patients in whom the dystrophin deletion left the nNOS-binding domain (exons 42-45) intact, whereas this did not occur in patients with deletions that involved this domain. Our results indicate that the novel internally deleted and shorter dystrophin induced by skipping exon 51 in patients with amenable deletions, can also restore the dystrophin-associated complex, further suggesting preserved functionality of the newly translated dystrophin.",
    "Resveratrol and the pharmacology of aging: a new vertebrate model to validate an old molecule. The natural phytoalexin resveratrol, found in grapes and red wine, recently rose to public fame for its positive effects on longevity in yeasts, worms and flies. Resveratrol anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory in vitro action on mammalian cell cultures also suggest a possible positive effect on human health and life-expectancy. To study the effects of resveratrol on vertebrate aging is obviously a particularly relevant question. We have studied resveratrol effects in a very short-lived vertebrate: the annual fish Nothobranchius furzeri. Resveratrol treatment prolonged lifespan and delayed the onset of age-related dysfunctions in this fish. This result identifies resveratrol as the first molecule which consistently retards aging in organisms as diverse as yeast, worm, fly and fish, but it also reveals the potential of this short-lived fish as an animal model for pharmacological research. Moreover, being related to stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) the \"pufferfishes\" Takifugu and Tetraodon, and even more closely related to medaka (Oryzias latipes), it can greatly beneficiate from the recent development of genomic resources for these fish models and in the future become a complete model system for the aging research community.",
    "Rilonacept in the treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders. Rilonacept (IL-1 Trap/Arcalyst) is a long-acting interleukin-1 (IL-1) blocker developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Initially, Regeneron entered into a joint development effort with Novartis to develop rilonacept for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but this was discontinued following the review of phase II clinical data showing that IL-1 blockade appeared to have limited benefit in RA. In February 2008, Regeneron received Orphan Drug approval from the Food and Drug Administration for rilonacept in the treatment of two cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) disorders, namely, familial cold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), for children and adults 12 years and older. CAPS is a group of inherited inflammatory disorders consisting of FCAS, MWS, neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID), also known as chronic infantile neurologic, cutaneous and articular (CINCA) syndrome, all associated with heterozygous mutations in the NLRP3 (CIAS1) gene, which encodes the protein NLRP3 or cryopyrin. Prior to the discovery of the NLRP3 (CIAS1) mutations and the advent of IL-1-targeted therapy, treatment was aimed at suppressing inflammation but with limited success. The dramatic success of selective blockade of IL-1beta, initially with the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra; Kineret(R) or anakinra/ Amgen, Inc.), not only provided supportive evidence for the role of IL-1beta in CAPS but also demonstrated the efficacy of targeting IL-1beta for treatment of these conditions. A high-affinity protein called rilonacept has been produced by cytokine Trap technology and was developed by Regeneron. The desirable longer half-life of rilonacept offers potential alternatives to patients who do not tolerate daily injections very well or have difficulty with drug compliance. The initial evidence for the beneficial effects of rilonacept for MWS and FCAS suggests that it would also be a suitable treatment for CNICA/NOMID. It is yet to be determined whether rilonacept would be an effective treatment for other chronic inflammatory conditions such as gout, familial Mediterranean fever and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis.",
    "Rilotumumab plus epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine as first-line therapy in advanced MET-positive gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer (RILOMET-1): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial. BACKGROUND: Rilotumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively targets the ligand of the MET receptor, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). We aimed to assess the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of rilotumumab combined with epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine, and to assess potential biomarkers, in patients with advanced MET-positive gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. METHODS: This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study was done at 152 centres in 27 countries. We recruited adults (aged > 18 years) with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, MET-positive tumours ( > 25% of tumour cells with membrane staining of > 1+ staining intensity), and evaluable disease, who had not received previous systemic therapy. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via a computerised voice response system to receive rilotumumab 15 mg/kg intravenously or placebo in combination with open-label chemotherapy (epirubicin 50 mg/m intravenously; cisplatin 60 mg/m intravenously; capecitabine 625 mg/m orally twice daily) in 21-day cycles for up to ten cycles. After completion of chemotherapy, patients continued to receive rilotumumab or placebo monotherapy until disease progression, intolerability, withdrawal of consent, or study termination. Randomisation was stratified by disease extent and ECOG performance status. Both patients and physicians were masked to study treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed by intention to treat. We report the final analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01697072. FINDINGS: Between Nov 7, 2012, and Nov 21, 2014, 609 patients were randomly assigned to rilotumumab plus epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine (rilotumumab group; n=304) or placebo plus epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine (placebo group; n=305). Study treatment was stopped early after an independent data monitoring committee found a higher number of deaths in the rilotumumab group than in the placebo group; all patients in the rilotumumab group subsequently discontinued all study treatment. Median follow-up was 7\u00b77 months (IQR 3\u00b76-12\u00b70) for patients in the rilotumumab group and 9\u00b74 months (5\u00b73-13\u00b71) for patients in the placebo group. Median overall survival was 8\u00b78 months (95% CI 7\u00b77-10\u00b72) in the rilotumumab group compared with 10\u00b77 months (9\u00b76-12\u00b74) in the placebo group (stratified hazard ratio 1\u00b734, 95% CI 1\u00b710-1\u00b763; p=0\u00b7003). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events in the rilotumumab and placebo groups were neutropenia (86 [29%] of 298 patients vs 97 [32%] of 299 patients), anaemia (37 [12%] vs 43 [14%]), and fatigue (30 [10%] vs 35 [12%]). The frequency of serious adverse events was similar in the rilotumumab and placebo groups (142 [48%] vs 149 [50%]). More deaths due to adverse events occurred in the rilotumumab group than the placebo group (42 [14%] vs 31 [10%]). In the rilotumumab group, 33 (11%) of 298 patients had fatal adverse events due to disease progression, and nine (3%) had fatal events not due to disease progression. In the placebo group, 23 (8%) of 299 patients had fatal adverse events due to disease progression, and eight (3%) had fatal events not due to disease progression. INTERPRETATION: Ligand-blocking inhibition of the MET pathway with rilotumumab is not effective in improving clinical outcomes in patients with MET-positive gastric or gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma. FUNDING: Amgen.",
    "Rindopepimut: an evidence-based review of its therapeutic potential in the treatment of EGFRvIII-positive glioblastoma. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor in adults and is universally fatal. Despite surgical resection, radiotherapy, and systemic chemotherapy, the median overall survival is less than 15 months. As current therapies are not tumor-specific, treatment commonly results in toxicity. The epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) is a naturally occurring mutant of EGFR and is expressed on approximately 20% to 30% of GBMs. As it is not expressed on normal cells, it is an ideal therapeutic target. Rindopepimut is a peptide vaccine which elicits EGFRvIII-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Phase I and II clinical trials have demonstrated significantly higher progression-free and overall survival times in vaccinated patients with EGFRvIII-expressing GBM tumors. Side effects are minimal and mainly consist of hypersensitivity reactions. Due to the efficacy and safety of rindopepimut, it is a promising therapy for patients with GBM. Currently, rindopepimut is undergoing clinical testing in an international Phase III trial for newly diagnosed GBM and a Phase II trial for relapsed GBM.",

    "Role of ABL family kinases in cancer: from leukaemia to solid tumours. The Abelson (ABL) family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, ABL1 and ABL2, transduces diverse extracellular signals to protein networks that control proliferation, survival, migration and invasion. ABL1 was first identified as an oncogene required for the development of leukaemias initiated by retroviruses or chromosome translocations. The demonstration that small-molecule ABL kinase inhibitors could effectively treat chronic myeloid leukaemia opened the door to the era of targeted cancer therapies. Recent reports have uncovered roles for ABL kinases in solid tumours. Enhanced ABL expression and activation in some solid tumours, together with altered cell polarity, invasion or growth induced by activated ABL kinases, suggest that drugs targeting these kinases may be useful for treating selected solid tumours.",
    "Role of ApoE in conformation-prone diseases and atherosclerosis. Three isoforms of human plasma apolipoprotein E (apoE) are ligands to lipoprotein receptors and influence in different manner the synthesis and catabolism of pro-atherogenic triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Among three isoforms, the apoE4 isoform is associated with increased frequency of atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The conformational transitions of beta-amyloid (Abeta) influenced by apoE and serum amyloid P (SAP) component are key events in AD development, the accumulation of intermediate diffusible and soluble oligomers of Abeta being of particular significance. SAP and apoE, in a different manner for the three isoforms, serve as \"pathological\" chaperones during the aggregation of Abeta considered as a conformation-prone process. In turn, apoE consisting of two domains self-associates in solution and intermediate structures differently populated for the three isoforms exist. The different structures of the three isoforms determine their different distribution among various plasma lipoproteins. The structural and metabolic consideration of the common apoE pathway(s) in two pathologies assumes four molecular targets for AD correction: (i) inhibition of the accumulation of diffusible soluble Abeta oligomers; (ii) inhibition of apoE synthesis and secretion by astrocytes, in particular, under lipid-lowering therapy; (iii) inhibition of the binding of apoE and/or SAP to Abeta; (iv) stimulation of the expression of cholesterol transporter ABCA1.",
    "Role of endogenous psychosine accumulation in oligodendrocyte differentiation and survival: implication for Krabbe disease. Krabbe disease is a lethal, demyelinating condition caused by genetic deficiency of galactocerebrosidase (GALC) and resultant accumulation of its cytotoxic substrate, psychosine (galactosylsphingosine), primarily in oligodendrocytes (OLs). Psychosine is generated by galactosylation of sphingosine by UDP-galactose:ceramide galactosyltransferase (CGT), a galactosylceramide synthesizing enzyme which is primarily expressed in OLs. The expression of CGT and the synthesis of galactosyl-sphingolipids are associated with the terminal differentiation of OL, but little is known about the participation of endogenous psychosine accumulation in OL differentiation under GALC deficient conditions. In this study, we report that accumulation of endogenous psychosine under GALC deficient Krabbe conditions impedes OL differentiation process both by decreasing the expression of myelin lipids and protein and by inducing the cell death of maturating OLs. The psychosine pathology under GALC deficient conditions involves participation of secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) activation and increase in its metabolites, as evidenced by attenuation of psychosine-induced pathology by treatment with pharmacological inhibitor of sPLA2 7,7-dimethyleicosadienoic acid (DEDA). These observations suggest for potential therapeutic efficacy of sPLA2 inhibitor in Krabbe disease.",
    "Role of fusaric acid in the development of 'Fusarium wilt' symptoms in tomato: Physiological, biochemical and proteomic perspectives. Fusarium wilt is one of the most prevalent and damaging diseases of tomato. Among various toxins secreted by the Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (causal agent of Fusarium wilt of tomato), fusaric acid (FA) is suspected to be a potent pathogenicity factor in tomato wilt disease development. With this rationale the present study was carried out with physiological, biochemical and proteomic perspectives. Treatment of FA was given to the leaves of tomato directly through infiltration to show the characteristic features of Fusarium wilt of tomato. The phytotoxic effect of FA was assessed in the form of cell death in tomato leaves which was observed by increased uptake of Evans blue stain. The measurement of electrolyte leakage was used as an indicator of the extent of cell death. The influence of FA on the leaf photosynthesis of tomato plant was investigated and it was found that FA strongly reduced the photosynthetic pigment contents of tomato leaves resulting to heavy suppression of leaf photosynthesis processes, which therefore affected leaf physiology finally leading to leaf wilting and necrosis. This cell death inducer (FA) produced an enormous oxidative burst during which large quantities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) like HO was generated in the treated leaf tissues of tomato plants which was evident from enhancement in lipid peroxidation. To assess the involvement of proteolysis in the cell death cascade induced by FA treatment, total protease activity was measured in the leaf tissues and it was found that the total protease activity increased with the treatment and leading to cell death. Furthermore, proteomic study was used as a powerful tool to understand the alterations in cellular protein expression in response to FA exposure. Differential expression in several proteins was observed in the present study. Proteomic analyses, thus, clearly indicate that proteins belonging to different functional classes are significantly affected in the plant leaf tissues after FA exposure leading to deterioration of structure and metabolism of cells. Thus, it is concluded that FA plays an important role in fungal pathogenicity by decreasing cell viability.",
    "S-adenosylmethionine inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced gene expression via modulation of histone methylation. UNLABELLED: We previously showed that S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) and its metabolite methylthioadenosine (MTA) blocked lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) expression in RAW (murine macrophage cell line) and Kupffer cells at the transcriptional level without affecting nuclear factor kappa B nuclear binding. However, the exact molecular mechanism or mechanisms of the inhibitory effect were unclear. While SAMe is a methyl donor, MTA is an inhibitor of methylation. SAMe can convert to MTA spontaneously, so the effect of exogenous SAMe may be mediated by MTA. The aim of our current work is to examine whether the mechanism of SAMe and MTA's inhibitory effect on proinflammatory mediators might involve modulation of histone methylation. In RAW cells, we found that LPS induced TNFalpha expression by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. SAMe and MTA treatment inhibited the LPS-induced increase in gene transcription. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we found that LPS increased the binding of trimethylated histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) to the TNFalpha promoter, and this was completely blocked by either SAMe or MTA pretreatment. Similar effects were observed with LPS-mediated induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). LPS increased the binding of histone methyltransferases Set1 and myeloid/lymphoid leukemia to these promoters, which was unaffected by SAMe or MTA. The effects of MTA in RAW cells were confirmed in vivo in LPS-treated mice. Exogenous SAMe is unstable and converts spontaneously to MTA, which is stable and cell-permeant. Treatment with SAMe doubled intracellular MTA and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) levels. SAH also inhibited H3K4 binding to TNFalpha and iNOS promoters. CONCLUSION: The mechanism of SAMe's pharmacologic inhibitory effect on proinflammatory mediators is mainly mediated by MTA and SAH at the level of histone methylation.",
    "S100A4 interacts with p53 in the nucleus and promotes p53 degradation. S100A4 is a small calcium-binding protein that is commonly overexpressed in a range of different tumor types, and it is widely accepted that S100A4 has an important role in the process of cancer metastasis. In vitro binding assays has shown that S100A4 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, indicating that S100A4 may have additional roles in tumor development. In the present study, we show that endogenous S100A4 and p53 interact in complex samples, and that the interaction increases after inhibition of MDM2-dependent p53 degradation using Nutlin-3A. Further, using proximity ligation assay, we show that the interaction takes place in the cell nucleus. S100A4 knockdown experiments in two p53 wild-type cell lines, A549 and HeLa, resulted in stabilization of p53 protein, indicating that S100A4 is promoting p53 degradation. Finally, we demonstrate that S100A4 knockdown leads to p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Thus, our data add a new layer to the oncogenic properties of S100A4 through its inhibition of p53-dependent processes.",
    "SOX2 anophthalmia syndrome and dental anomalies. SOX2 anophthalmia syndrome is an uncommon autosomal dominant syndrome caused by mutations in the SOX2 gene and clinically characterized by severe eye malformations (anophthalmia/microphthalmia) and extraocular anomalies mainly involving brain, esophagus, and genitalia. In this work, a patient with the SOX2 anophthalmia syndrome and exhibiting a novel dental anomaly is described. SOX2 genotyping in this patient revealed an apparently de novo c.70del20 deletion, a commonly reported SOX2 mutation. A review of the phenotypic variation observed in patients carrying the recurrent SOX2 c.70del20 mutation is presented. Although dental anomalies are uncommonly reported in the SOX2 anophthalmia syndrome, we suggest that a dental examination should be performed in patients with SOX2 mutations.",
    "SUMO and Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common degenerative disorders of the central nervous system that produces motor and non-motor symptoms. The majority of cases are idiopathic and characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies containing fibrillar \u03b1-synuclein. Small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) immunoreactivity was observed among others in cases with PD. Key disease-associated proteins are SUMO-modified, linking this posttranslational modification to neurodegeneration. SUMOylation and SUMO-mediated mechanisms have been intensively studied in recent years, revealing nuclear and extranuclear functions for SUMO in a variety of cellular processes, including the regulation of transcriptional activity, modulation of signal transduction pathways, and response to cellular stress. This points to a role for SUMO more than just an antagonist to ubiquitin and proteasomal degradation. The identification of risk and age-at-onset gene loci was a breakthrough in PD and promoted the understanding of molecular mechanisms in the pathology. PD has been increasingly linked with mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired mitochondrial quality control. Interestingly, SUMO is involved in many of these processes and up-regulated in response to cellular stress, further emphasizing the importance of SUMOylation in physiology and disease.",
    "Salivary adiponectin levels are associated with training intensity but not with bone mass or reproductive function in elite Rhythmic Gymnasts. Elite Rhythmic Gymnasts (RGs) constitute a unique metabolic model and they are prone to developing Anorexia Athletica. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of training intensity on salivary adiponectin levels and assess a possible role of salivary adiponectin levels as a predictive factor of reproductive dysfunction and bone mass acquisition in elite RGs. The study included 80 elite female RGs participating in the World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championship tournament held in Montpellier, France on September 2011. Anthropometric values were assessed, training data and menstrual pattern were recorded, bone mass was measured with Broadband ultrasound attenuation (dB/Mhz) and baseline salivary adiponectin levels were determined. The athletes were classified as intensely and very intensely trained, considering the mean training intensity (40.84h/week). Moreover, considering their reproductive status, they were divided into RG's with normal menstruation, primary amenorrhea and oligomenorrhea. All comparisons were adjusted to age, BMI and body fat percentage differences. Very intensely trained RGs showed higher salivary adiponectin levels (p=0.05). Moreover, salivary adiponectin levels showed significant correlation with training intensity (r=0.409, p=0.003). On the other hand, no association of salivary adiponectin levels was documented with either reproductive function or bone mass acquisition. The results of the present study suggest that, in elite RGs, salivary adiponectin levels are associated with the intensity of training, possibly reflecting the deterioration of energy balance rather than the training stress. On the other hand, a predictive role of salivary adiponectin levels in reproductive dysfunction or bone mass acquisition could not be supported.",
    "Scarlet Fever Upsurge in England and Molecular-Genetic Analysis in North-West London, 2014. Scarlet fever notifications surged across the United Kingdom in spring 2014.

    "Self-reported ill health in male UK Gulf War veterans: a retrospective cohort study. BACKGROUND: Forces deployed to the first Gulf War report more ill health than veterans who did not serve there. Many studies of post-Gulf morbidity are based on relatively small sample sizes and selection bias is often a concern. In a setting where selection bias relating to the ill health of veterans may be reduced, we: i) examined self-reported adult ill health in a large sample of male UK Gulf War veterans and a demographically similar non-deployed comparison group; and ii) explored self-reported ill health among veterans who believed that they had Gulf War syndrome. METHODS: This study uses data from a retrospective cohort study of reproduction and child health in which a validated postal questionnaire was sent to all UK Gulf War veterans (GWV) and a comparison cohort of Armed Service personnel who were not deployed to the Gulf (NGWV). The cohort for analysis comprises 42,818 males who responded to the questionnaire. RESULTS: We confirmed that GWV report higher rates of general ill health. GWV were significantly more likely to have reported at least one new medical symptom or disease since 1990 than NGWV (61% versus 37%, OR 2.7, 95% CI 2.5-2.8). They were also more likely to report higher numbers of symptoms. The strongest associations were for mood swings (OR 20.9, 95%CI 16.2-27.0), memory loss/lack of concentration (OR 19.6, 95% CI 15.5-24.8), night sweats (OR 9.9, 95% CI 6.5-15.2), general fatigue (OR 9.6, 95% CI 8.3-11.1) and sexual dysfunction (OR 4.6, 95%CI 3.2-6.6). 6% of GWV believed they had Gulf War syndrome (GWS), and this was associated with the highest symptom reporting. CONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of reported ill health among GWV were confirmed. This study was the first to use a questionnaire which did not focus specifically on the veterans' symptoms themselves. Nevertheless, the results are consistent with those of other studies of post-Gulf war illness and thus strengthen overall findings in this area of research. Further examination of the mechanisms underlying the reporting of ill health is required.",
    "Semi-synthesis of cyclosporins. BACKGROUND: Since its isolation in 1970, and discovery of its potent inhibitory activity on T-cell proliferation, cyclosporin A (CsA) has been shown to play a significant role in diverse fields of biology. Furthermore, chemical modification of CsA has led to analogs with distinct biological activities associated with its protein receptor family, cyclophilins. SCOPE OF REVIEW: This review systematically collates the synthetic chemistry performed at each of the eleven amino acids, and provides examples of the utility of such transformations. The various modifications of CsA are traced from early, modest chemistry performed at the unique Bmt residue, through the remarkable use of a polyanion enolate that can be stereoselectively manipulated, and onto application of more recently developed olefin metathesis chemistry to prepare new CsA derivatives with unexpected biological activity. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: The myriad biological activities of CsA and its synthetic derivatives have inspired the development of new approaches to modify the CsA ring. In turn, these new CsA derivatives have served as tools in the discovery of new roles for cyclophilins. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This review provides information on the types of cyclosporin derivatives that are available to the many biologists working in this field, and should be of value to the medicinal chemist trying to discover drugs based on CsA. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Proline-directed foldases: Cell signaling catalysts and drug targets.",
    "SeqArray-a storage-efficient high-performance data format for WGS variant calls. Motivation: Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data are being generated at an unprecedented rate. Analysis of WGS data requires a flexible data format to store the different types of DNA variation. Variant call format (VCF) is a general text-based format developed to store variant genotypes and their annotations. However, VCF files are large and data retrieval is relatively slow. Here we introduce a new WGS variant data format implemented in the R/Bioconductor package 'SeqArray' for storing variant calls in an array-oriented manner which provides the same capabilities as VCF, but with multiple high compression options and data access using high-performance parallel computing. Results: Benchmarks using 1000 Genomes Phase 3 data show file sizes are 14.0 Gb (VCF), 12.3 Gb (BCF, binary VCF), 3.5 Gb (BGT) and 2.6 Gb (SeqArray) respectively. Reading genotypes in the SeqArray package are two to three times faster compared with the htslib C library using BCF files. For the allele frequency calculation, the implementation in the SeqArray package is over 5 times faster than PLINK v1.9 with VCF and BCF files, and over 16 times faster than vcftools. When used in conjunction with R/Bioconductor packages, the SeqArray package provides users a flexible, feature-rich, high-performance programming environment for analysis of WGS variant data.

    "Ser129D mutant alpha-synuclein induces earlier motor dysfunction while S129A results in distinctive pathology in a rat model of Parkinson's disease. Alpha-synuclein phosphorylated at serine 129 (S129) is highly elevated in Parkinson's disease patients where it mainly accumulates in the Lewy bodies. Several groups have studied the role of phosphorylation at the S129 in \u03b1-synuclein in a rat model for Parkinson's disease using recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vectors. The results obtained are inconsistent and accordingly the role of S129 phosphorylation in \u03b1-synuclein toxicity remains unclear. This prompted us to re-examine the neuropathological and behavioral effects of the S129 modified \u03b1-synuclein species in vivo. For this purpose, we used two mutated forms of human \u03b1-synuclein in which the S129 was replaced either with an alanine (S129A), to block phosphorylation, or with an aspartate (S129D), to mimic phosphorylation, and compared them with the wild type \u03b1-synuclein. This approach was similar in design to previous studies, however our investigation of dopaminergic degeneration also included performing a detailed study of the \u03b1-synuclein induced pathology in the striatum and the analysis of motor deficits. Our results showed that overexpressing S129D or wild type \u03b1-synuclein resulted in an accelerated dopaminergic fiber loss as compared with S129A \u03b1-synuclein. Furthermore, the motor deficit seen in the group treated with the mutant S129D \u03b1-synuclein appeared earlier than the other two forms of \u03b1-synuclein. Conversely, S129A \u03b1-synuclein showed significantly larger pathological \u03b1-synuclein-positive inclusions, and slower dopaminergic fiber loss, when compared to the other two forms of \u03b1-synuclein, suggesting a neuroprotective effect of the mutation. When examined at long-term, all three \u03b1-synuclein forms resulted in pathological accumulations of \u03b1-synuclein in striatal fibers and dopaminergic cell death in the substantia nigra. Our data show that changes in the S129 residue of \u03b1-synuclein influence the rate of pathology and neurodegeneration, with an overall deleterious effect of exchanging S129 to a residue mimicking its phosphorylated state.",

    "Should the annular tendon of the eye be named 'annulus of Zinn' or 'of Valsalva'? The annular tendon is commonly named 'annulus of Zinn', from the German anatomist and botanist Johann Gottfried Zinn (1727-1759) who described this structure in his Descriptio anatomica oculi humani (Anatomical Description of the Human Eye, 1755). This structure, however, had been previously discovered not by Zinn, but by Antonio Maria Valsalva (1666-1723) some decades before the publication of Zinn, in his Dissertatio anatomica prima and Dissertatio anatomica altera (First and Second Anatomical Dissertations), inside Valsalva's Opera omnia published in 1740. We advance that this structure could be re-named such as 'annulus of Valsalva-Zinn' because Valsalva, even making a mistake in its functional interpretation, first described this anatomical structure. Likewise, Valsalva, with his discovery, advanced a revolutionary idea for that time on the usefulness of anatomy for clinic and pathology.",
    "Signalling to transcription: store-operated Ca2+ entry and NFAT activation in lymphocytes. In cells of the immune system that are stimulated by antigen or antigen-antibody complexes, Ca(2+) entry from the extracellular medium is driven by depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores and occurs through specialized store-operated Ca(2+) channels known as Ca(2+)-release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channels. The process of store-operated Ca(2+) influx is essential for short-term as well as long-term responses by immune-system cells. Short-term responses include mast cell degranulation and killing of target cells by effector cytolytic T cells, whereas long-term responses typically involve changes in gene transcription and include T and B cell proliferation and differentiation. Transcription downstream of Ca(2+) influx is in large part funneled through the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), a heavily phosphorylated protein that is cytoplasmic in resting cells, but that enters the nucleus when dephosphorylated by the calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin. The importance of the Ca(2+)/calcineurin/NFAT signalling pathway for lymphocyte activation is underscored by the finding that the underlying defect in a family with a hereditary severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) syndrome is a defect in CRAC channel function, store-operated Ca(2+) entry, NFAT activation and transcription of cytokines, chemokines and many other NFAT target genes whose transcription is essential for productive immune defence. We recently used a two-pronged genetic approach to identify Orai1 as the pore subunit of the CRAC channel. On the one hand, we initiated a positional cloning approach in which we utilised genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapping to identify the genomic region linked to the mutant gene in the SCID family described above. In parallel, we used a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila to identify critical regulators of NFAT nuclear translocation and store-operated Ca(2+) entry. These approaches, together with subsequent mutational and electrophysiological analyses, converged to identify human Orai1 as a pore subunit of the CRAC channel and as the gene product mutated in the SCID patients.",
    "Simpson Grade I-III Resection of Spinal Atypical (World Health Organization Grade II) Meningiomas is Associated With Symptom Resolution and Low Recurrence. BACKGROUND: Because of their rarity, outcomes regarding spinal atypical meningiomas (AMs) remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To describe the recurrence rate and postoperative outcomes after resection of spinal AMs, and to discuss an appropriate resection strategy and adjuvant therapy for spinal AMs. METHODS: Data from all patients who presented with spinal AMs to 2 tertiary referral centers between 1998 and 2013 were obtained by chart review. RESULTS: From 102 patients with spinal meningioma, 20 AM tumors (7 cervical, 11 thoracic, 2 thoracolumbar) were identified in 18 patients (median age, 50 years [range, 19-75] at time of resection; 11% male; median follow-up, 32 months [range, 1-179] after resection). Before resection, patients had sensory deficits (70%), pain (70%), weakness (60%), ataxia (50%), spasticity (65%), and incontinence (35%). One tumor presented asymptomatically. Simpson grade I, II, III, and IV resection were achieved in 3 (15%), 13 (65%), 2 (10%), and 2 (10%) tumors, respectively. One patient that underwent Simpson grade III resection received adjuvant radiation therapy. After Simpson grade I-III or gross total resection, no tumors recurred (0%; confidence interval, 0%-17.6%). After Simpson grade IV resection, 1 tumor recurred (50%; confidence interval, 1.3%-98.7%). With the exception of 1 patient who had bilateral paraplegia perioperatively, all other patients experienced improvement of preoperative symptoms after surgery (median time, 3.6 months [range, 1-13] after resection). CONCLUSION: Despite published cases suggesting an aggressive clinical course for spinal AMs, this series of spinal AMs reports that gross total resection without adjuvant radiation therapy resulted in symptom resolution and low recurrence.",
    "Slings in iatrogenic male incontinence: Current status. OBJECTIVES: The increasing number of prostatectomies entails an increasing number of patients suffering from iatrogenic incontinence despite improved surgical techniques. The severity of this problem often requires invasive treatments such as periurethral injection of bulking agents, artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) implantation, and sub-urethral sling positioning. The artificial urethral sphincter has represented, until today, the gold standard but, in the recent years, sling systems have been investigated as minimally invasive alternative options. Today, three different sling procedures are commonly performed: bone-anchored, readjustable, and trans-obturator slings systems. The aim of this review is to critically report the current status of sling systems in the treatment of iatrogenic male incontinence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MEDLINE and PubMed databases were searched and all articles between 1974 and 2009 were evaluated. RESULTS: With regard to bone-anchored, readjustable, and trans-obturator slings systems, cure rates ranged between 58.0% and 86.0%, 55.5% and 73.0%, and 40.0% and 63.0%, respectively, while major complication rates ranged between 0 and 14.5%, 10.0 and 22.2%, and 0 and 10.0%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Suburethral slings are the only alternative techniques which can be favorably compared with the AUS, showing more advantages with respect to AUS implantations which are mainly represented by a quick and less invasive approach, low morbidity, and low costs. In spite of the difficulty in identifying the most effective sling procedure, overall, sling systems can be recommended for patients with persistent mild or moderate incontinence. However, the indication can also be extended to patients with severe incontinence, after appropriate counseling, allowing AUS implantation in the event of sling failure.",
    "Small heat shock protein 20 interacts with protein phosphatase-1 and enhances sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium cycling. BACKGROUND: Heat shock proteins (Hsp) are known to enhance cell survival under various stress conditions. In the heart, the small Hsp20 has emerged as a key mediator of protection against apoptosis, remodeling, and ischemia/reperfusion injury. Moreover, Hsp20 has been implicated in modulation of cardiac contractility ex vivo. The objective of this study was to determine the in vivo role of Hsp20 in the heart and the mechanisms underlying its regulatory effects in calcium (Ca) cycling. METHODS AND RESULTS: Hsp20 overexpression in intact animals resulted in significant enhancement of cardiac function, coupled with augmented Ca cycling and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca load in isolated cardiomyocytes. This was associated with specific increases in phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN) at both Ser16 and Thr17, relieving its inhibition of the apparent Ca affinity of SERCA2a. Accordingly, the inotropic effects of Hsp20 were abrogated in cardiomyocytes expressing nonphosphorylatable PLN (S16A/T17A). Interestingly, the activity of type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1), a known regulator of PLN signaling, was significantly reduced by Hsp20 overexpression, suggesting that the Hsp20 stimulatory effects are partially mediated through the PP1-PLN axis. This hypothesis was supported by cell fractionation, coimmunoprecipitation, and coimmunolocalization studies, which revealed an association between Hsp20, PP1, and PLN. Furthermore, recombinant protein studies confirmed a physical interaction between AA 73 to 160 in Hsp20 and AA 163 to 330 in PP1. CONCLUSIONS: Hsp20 is a novel regulator of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca cycling by targeting the PP1-PLN axis. These findings, coupled with the well-recognized cardioprotective role of Hsp20, suggest a dual benefit of targeting Hsp20 in heart disease.",
    "Small, smaller, smallest: the origins and evolution of ancient dual symbioses in a Phloem-feeding insect. Many insects rely on bacterial symbionts with tiny genomes specialized for provisioning nutrients lacking in host diets. Xylem sap and phloem sap are both deficient as insect diets, but differ dramatically in nutrient content, potentially affecting symbiont genome evolution. For sap-feeding insects, sequenced symbiont genomes are available only for phloem-feeding examples from the suborder Sternorrhyncha and xylem-feeding examples from the suborder Auchenorrhyncha, confounding comparisons. We sequenced genomes of the obligate symbionts, Sulcia muelleri and Nasuia deltocephalinicola, of the phloem-feeding pest insect, Macrosteles quadrilineatus (Auchenorrhyncha: Cicadellidae). Our results reveal that Nasuia-ALF has the smallest bacterial genome yet sequenced (112 kb), and that the Sulcia-ALF genome (190 kb) is smaller than that of Sulcia in other insect lineages. Together, these symbionts retain the capability to synthesize the 10 essential amino acids, as observed for several symbiont pairs from xylem-feeding Auchenorrhyncha. Nasuia retains genes enabling synthesis of two amino acids, DNA replication, transcription, and translation. Both symbionts have lost genes underlying ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation, possibly as a consequence of the enriched sugar content of phloem. Shared genomic features, including reassignment of the UGA codon from Stop to tryptophan, and phylogenetic results suggest that Nasuia-ALF is most closely related to Zinderia, the betaproteobacterial symbiont of spittlebugs. Thus, Nasuia/Zinderia and Sulcia likely represent ancient associates that have co-resided in hosts since the divergence of leafhoppers and spittlebugs >200 Ma, and possibly since the origin of the Auchenorrhyncha, >260 Ma.",
    "Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition with canagliflozin in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) is expressed primarily in the kidneys and is involved in the reabsorption of filtered glucose in the renal tubule. Clinical trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus demonstrate a significant clinical effect in decreasing serum glucose, hemoglobin A1C, body weight, systolic blood pressure, improving \u03b2-cell function, and minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia. This report reviews the potentially beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes mellitus, specifically focusing on canagliflozin, the only SGLT2 inhibitor approved for use in the United States.",
    "Sofosbuvir-based therapy cures hepatitis C virus infection after prior treatment failures in a patient with concurrent lymphoma. We report on the first well-tolerated and successful use of sofosbuvir-based therapy in a patient in whom chronic infection with hepatitis C had preceded the development of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The patient had previously failed numerous attempts to clear the hepatitis C virus with traditional antiviral schedules. We demonstrate that sofosbuvir-based therapy resulted in cure of hepatitis C in a patient who had relapsed during combination therapy with an NS5A inhibitor, an NS3 protease inhibitor and ribavirin, as well as treatment failures to multiple courses of interferon-based therapy. This report also suggests that eradication of hepatitis C virus may result in the short-term prevention of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma relapse. The findings from our case require further validation in future cohorts of patients.",
    "Spatial variability in sulphur isotope values of archaeological and modern cod (Gadus morhua). RATIONALE: This study presents the first sulphur isotope data of modern and archaeological cod (Gadus morhua) bone collagen, undertaken to identify large-scale spatial variability of significance as both baseline values for studies of human diet and a potential variable in isotope-based studies of fish trading. METHODS: Collagen was extracted from modern and archaeological cod bones using a weak HCl solution and analysed for its sulphur isotopic composition by isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). RESULTS: The archaeological cod have sulphur isotope values ranging from +9.1\u2030 to +18.2\u2030, whereas values for modern specimens range from +14.8\u2030 to +18.3\u2030. The modern data show values implying less freshwater influence, consistent with their offshore catch locations, but also corroborate some of the regional variability evident from the archaeological evidence. CONCLUSIONS: The archaeological data have a large range of sulphur isotope values compared with the modern populations, probably indicating they were taken from a wide range of geographic locations, including both coastal and offshore locales. They show broad trends of regional difference that may relate to both the fish populations targeted (e.g. 'inshore' versus 'offshore') and the baseline values of the local ecosystem (e.g. degree of freshwater input from river systems).",
    "Specific isoforms of p73 control the induction of cell death induced by the viral proteins, E1A or apoptin. A member of the p53 family, p73, has several isoforms and differentially regulates transcription of genes involved in the control of the cell cycle and apoptosis. We have previously shown efficient and p53-independent, tumor-specific cell death induced by the viral proteins E1A and Apoptin. Here, we demonstrate that the induction of apoptosis by these viral proteins involves activation of TAp73. Both E1A and Apoptin induced expression of endogenous TAp73 and the p53/p73 BH3-only pro-apoptotic target, PUMA, independently of the p53 function. Furthermore, exogenous expression of TAp73 isoforms, particularly TAp73beta, sensitized cells to killing by both E1A and Apoptin, while expression of DeltaNp73alpha blocked this activity. Besides, knockout of the p73 regulator, c-Abl, attenuated E1A-induced apoptosis. In accordance with the role of p73 in apoptosis induced by these viral proteins, overexpression of TAp73beta strongly induced apoptosis in p53-deficient cancer cells in vitro and in HNSCC xenografts. Using a doxycycline-inducible system, we provide evidence for target selectivity and significant differences in protein stability for specific p73 isoforms, suggesting a diverse and pivotal role for p73 in response to various genotoxic agents. Collectively, our data show that in the absence of the p53 function, viral proteins E1A and Apoptin utilize the p73 pathway to induce efficient tumor cell death.",
    "Specific mutations in the HEXA gene among Iraqi Jewish Tay-Sachs disease carriers: dating of founder ancestor. The incidence of Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) carriers, as defined by enzyme assay, is 1:29 among Ashkenazi Jews and 1:110 among Moroccan Jews. An elevated carrier frequency of 1:140 was also observed in the Iraqi Jews (IJ), while in other Israeli populations the world's pan-ethnic frequency of approximately 1:280 has been found. Recently a novel mutation, G749T, has been reported in 38.7% of the IJ carriers (24/62). Here we report a second novel HEXA mutation specific to the IJ TDS carriers: a substitution of cytosine 1351 by guanosine (C1351G), resulting in the change of leucine to valine in position 451. This mutation was found in 33.9% (21/62) of the carriers and in none of 100 non-carrier IJ. In addition to the two specific mutations, 14.5% (9/62) of the IJ carriers bear a known \"Jewish\" mutation (Ashkenazi or Moroccan) and 11.3% (7/62) carry a known \"non-Jewish\" mutation. In 1 DNA sample no mutation has yet been detected. To investigate the genetic history of the IJ-specific mutations (C1351G and G749T), the allelic distribution of four polymorphic markers (D15S131, D15S1025, D15S981, D15S1050) was analyzed in IJ heterozygotes and ethnically matched controls. Based on linkage disequilibrium, recombination factor (theta) between the markers and mutated loci, and the population growth correction, we deduced that G749T occurred in a founder ancestor 44.8 +/- 14.2 generations (g) ago [95% confidence interval (CI) 17.0-72.6 g] and C1351G arose 80.4 +/- 35.9 g ago (95% CI 44.5-116.3 g). Thus, the estimated dates for introduction of mutations are: 626 +/- 426 A.D. (200-1052 A.D.) for G749T and 442 +/- 1077 B.C. (1519 B.C. to 635 A.D.) for C1351G.",
    "Spermidine protects against \u03b1-synuclein neurotoxicity. As our society ages, neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson`s disease (PD) are increasing in pandemic proportions. While mechanistic understanding of PD is advancing, a treatment with well tolerable drugs is still elusive. Here, we show that administration of the naturally occurring polyamine spermidine, which declines continuously during aging in various species, alleviates a series of PD-related degenerative processes in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, two established model systems for PD pathology. In the fruit fly, simple feeding with spermidine inhibited loss of climbing activity and early organismal death upon heterologous expression of human \u03b1-synuclein, which is thought to be the principal toxic trigger of PD. In this line, administration of spermidine rescued \u03b1-synuclein-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons, a hallmark of PD, in nematodes. Alleviation of PD-related neurodegeneration by spermidine was accompanied by induction of autophagy, suggesting that this cytoprotective process may be responsible for the beneficial effects of spermidine administration.",
    "Spinal but not cortical microglia acquire an atypical phenotype with high VEGF, galectin-3 and osteopontin, and blunted inflammatory responses in ALS rats. Activation of microglia, CNS resident immune cells, is a pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor neurons. Despite evidence that microglia contribute to disease progression, the exact role of these cells in ALS pathology remains unknown. We immunomagnetically isolated microglia from different CNS regions of SOD1(G93A) rats at three different points in disease progression: presymptomatic, symptom onset and end-stage. We observed no differences in microglial number or phenotype in presymptomatic rats compared to wild-type controls. Although after disease onset there was no macrophage infiltration, there were significant increases in microglial numbers in the spinal cord, but not cortex. At disease end-stage, microglia were characterized by high expression of galectin-3, osteopontin and VEGF, and concomitant downregulated expression of TNF\u03b1, IL-6, BDNF and arginase-1. Flow cytometry revealed the presence of at least two phenotypically distinct microglial populations in the spinal cord. Immunohistochemistry showed that galectin-3/osteopontin positive microglia were restricted to the ventral horns of the spinal cord, regions with severe motor neuron degeneration. End-stage SOD1(G93A) microglia from the cortex, a less affected region, displayed similar gene expression profiles to microglia from wild-type rats, and displayed normal responses to systemic inflammation induced by LPS. On the other hand, end-stage SOD1(G93A) spinal microglia had blunted responses to systemic LPS suggesting that in addition to their phenotypic changes, they may also be functionally impaired. Thus, after disease onset, microglia acquired unique characteristics that do not conform to typical M1 (inflammatory) or M2 (anti-inflammatory) phenotypes. This transformation was observed only in the most affected CNS regions, suggesting that overexpression of mutated hSOD1 is not sufficient to trigger these changes in microglia. These novel observations suggest that microglial regional and phenotypic heterogeneity may be an important consideration when designing new therapeutic strategies targeting microglia and neuroinflammation in ALS.",
    "Spinal muscular atrophy and therapeutic prospects. The molecular genetic basis of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder, is the loss of function of the survival motor neuron gene (SMN1). The SMN2 gene, a nearly identical copy of SMN1, has been detected as a promising target for SMA therapy. Both genes are ubiquitously expressed and encode identical proteins, but markedly differ in their splicing patterns: While SMN1 produces full-length (FL)-SMN transcripts only, the majority of SMN2 transcripts lacks exon 7. Transcriptional SMN2 activation or modulation of its splicing pattern to increase FL-SMN levels is believed to be clinically beneficial and therefore a crucial challenge in SMA research. Drugs such as valproic acid, phenylbutyrate, sodium butyrate, M344 and SAHA that mainly act as histone deacetylase inhibitors can mediate both: they stimulate the SMN2 gene transcription and/or restore the splicing pattern, thereby elevating the levels of FL-SMN2 protein. Preliminary phase II clinical trials and individual experimental curative approaches SMA patients show promising results. However, phase III double-blind placebo controlled clinical trials have to finally prove the efficacy of these drugs.",
    "Splicing-dependent RNA polymerase pausing in yeast. In eukaryotic cells, there is evidence for functional coupling between transcription and processing of pre-mRNAs. To better understand this coupling, we performed a high-resolution kinetic analysis of transcription and splicing in budding yeast. This revealed that shortly after induction of transcription, RNA polymerase accumulates transiently around the 3' end of the intron on two reporter genes. This apparent transcriptional pause coincides with splicing factor recruitment and with the first detection of spliced mRNA and is repeated periodically thereafter. Pausing requires productive splicing, as it is lost upon mutation of the intron and restored by suppressing the splicing defect. The carboxy-terminal domain of the paused polymerase large subunit is hyperphosphorylated on serine 5, and phosphorylation of serine 2 is first detected here. Phosphorylated polymerase also accumulates around the 3' splice sites of constitutively expressed, endogenous yeast genes. We propose that transcriptional pausing is imposed by a checkpoint associated with cotranscriptional splicing.",
    "Stem cells. m6A mRNA methylation facilitates resolution of na\u00efve pluripotency toward differentiation. Na\u00efve and primed pluripotent states retain distinct molecular properties, yet limited knowledge exists on how their state transitions are regulated. Here, we identify Mettl3, an N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) transferase, as a regulator for terminating murine na\u00efve pluripotency. Mettl3 knockout preimplantation epiblasts and na\u00efve embryonic stem cells are depleted for m(6)A in mRNAs, yet are viable. However, they fail to adequately terminate their na\u00efve state and, subsequently, undergo aberrant and restricted lineage priming at the postimplantation stage, which leads to early embryonic lethality. m(6)A predominantly and directly reduces mRNA stability, including that of key na\u00efve pluripotency-promoting transcripts. This study highlights a critical role for an mRNA epigenetic modification in vivo and identifies regulatory modules that functionally influence na\u00efve and primed pluripotency in an opposing manner.",
    "Stress responses in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L). XXII. cDNA cloning and characterization of an elicitor-inducible isoflavone 7-O-methyltransferase. Medicarpin, the major phytoalexin in alfalfa, is synthesized via the isoflavonoid branch of phenylpropanoid metabolism. The methyl group at the 9 position of medicarpin is generally accepted to arise via the methylation of the 4' position (B-ring) of daidzein. Surprisingly, the isoflavone-O-methyltransferase (IOMT), which is induced along with other enzymes involved in medicarpin biosynthesis, methylates the A-ring 7-hydroxyl group of daidzein in vitro, a reaction that probably does not occur in vivo. Utilizing internal amino acid sequence information from purified alfalfa IOMT, we have isolated three full-length IOMT cDNA clones. A search of the protein databases revealed sequence similarities to O-methyltransferases from various sources. The highest match (50.5% identity) was found between IOMT8 and 6a-hydroxymaackiain 3-O-methyltransferase from Pisum sativum. The molecular weight of alfalfa IOMT expressed in Escherichia coli was similar to that of purified IOMT from alfalfa cell cultures (41 kDa by SDS-PAGE). The recombinant enzyme catalyzed the O-methylation of A-ring hydroxyl group(s) of isoflavones, and could also methylate the pterocarpan (+) 6a-hydroxymaackiain. Alfalfa contains multiple IOMT genes, and closely related sequences are present in the genomes of chickpea and cowpea, species that also produce B-ring methylated isoflavonoids in vivo. Northern blot analysis indicated that IOMT transcripts are rapidly induced following elicitation, prior to the increase in IOMT activity and medicarpin accumulation. The possible role of the isoflavone 7-OMT in the synthesis of formononetin in vivo is discussed.",
    "Striatal glutamate release in L-DOPA-induced dyskinetic animals. L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia is a common side effect developed after chronic treatment with 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-l-alanine (l-DOPA) in Parkinson's disease. The biological mechanisms behind this side effect are not fully comprehended although involvement of dopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic systems has been suggested. The present study utilizes in vivo amperometry to investigate the impact from unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions and l-DOPA (4 mg/kg, including benserazide 15 mg/kg) -induced dyskinetic behavior on striatal basal extracellular glutamate concentration and potassium-evoked glutamate release in urethane-anesthetized rats. Recordings were performed before and after local L-DOPA application in the striatum. In addition, effects from the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist (2R)-(+)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin hydrobromide (8-OHDPAT; 1 mg/kg) was assessed on glutamate release and on dyskinetic behavior. The results revealed a bilateral = 30% reduction of basal extracellular glutamate concentration and attenuated potassium-evoked glutamate release after a unilateral dopamine-depletion in L-DOPA na\u00efve animals. In dyskinetic subjects, basal glutamate concentration was comparable to normal controls, although potassium-evoked glutamate release was reduced to similar levels as in drug na\u00efve dopamine-lesioned animals. Furthermore, acute striatal L-DOPA administration attenuated glutamate release in all groups, except in the dopamine-lesioned striatum of dyskinetic animals. Co-administration of 8-OHDPAT and L-DOPA decreased dyskinesia in dopamine-lesioned animals, but did not affect potassium-evoked glutamate release, which was seen in normal animals. These findings indicate altered glutamate transmission upon dopamine-depletion and dyskinesia.",
    "Structural ramification for acetyl-lysine recognition by the bromodomain of human BRG1 protein, a central ATPase of the SWI/SNF remodeling complex. Bromodomains represent an extensive family of evolutionarily conserved domains that are found in many chromatin-associated proteins such as histone acetyltransferases (HAT) and subunits of ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes. These domains are associated with acetylated lysine residues that bind both in vivo and in vitro; for example, they bind to the N-acetylated lysines of the histone tail of nucleosomes. In this report, we determined the structure of the bromodomain from human brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1) protein, a subunit of an ATP-dependent switching/sucrose nonfermenting (SWI/SNF) remodeling complex, and have also characterized its in vitro interaction with N-acetylated lysine peptides from histones. In addition to a typical all-alpha-helical fold that was observed in the bromodomains, we observed for the first time a small beta-sheet in the ZA loop region of the BRG1 protein. The BRG1 bromodomain exhibited binding, albeit weak, to acetylated peptides that were derived from histones H3 and H4. We have compared the acetyl-lysine binding sites of BRG1 bromodomain with the yGCN5 (general control of amino acid biosynthesis). By modeling the acetylated-lysine peptide into the BRG1 bromodomain structure, we were able to explain the weak binding of acetylated-lysine peptides to this bromodomain.",
    "Structure-function relationship of the plant photosynthetic pigment-protein complex LHCII studied with molecular spectroscopy techniques. LHCII, the largest plant photosynthetic pigment-protein complex of photosystem II, is a most abundant membrane protein in living organisms and comprises approximately half of the pool of chlorophyll molecules in the biosphere. The principal role of this pigment-protein complex is to collect sunlight quanta and transfer electronic excitations toward the reaction centers, where the primary photosynthetic electric charge separation reactions take place. The LHCII protein, as a major protein component of the photosynthetic membranes, modulates also the structural and dynamic properties of the lipid phase of the membranes. According to the recent concepts, one of the physiological roles of LHCII is also a protection of the photosynthetic apparatus against oxidative damage caused by illumination with high intensity light. Detailed examination of all those physiological functions of LHCII, in relation to the complex structure, was possible owing to the application of several molecular spectroscopy techniques. Some examples of such studies are presented in this chapter. The examples of application of steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared absorption spectroscopy, and resonance Raman scattering spectroscopy are presented and discussed.",
    "Studies of complex Ph translocations in cases with chronic myelogenous leukemia and one with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The BCR/ABL gene fusion, the hallmark of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is generated in 2-10% of patients by a variant Ph translocation involving 9q34, 22q11.2, and one or more additional genomic regions. The objective of this study was the characterization by conventional and molecular cytogenetics of complex variant Ph translocations present at diagnosis. FISH studies were performed in 7 cases using the LSI BCR/ABL ES probe allowing the detection of the fusion BCR/ABL gene on the Ph chromosome in all of them and 9q34 deletions in 2 cases. Three cryptic complex rearrangements were detected by FISH studies. The third and the fourth chromosome regions involved in the 8 complex variant translocations were: 1q21, 1p36, 5q31, 11q13, 12q13, 12p13, and 20q12. In conclusion, FISH studies have been useful in the detection of the BCR/ABL rearrangements and 9q34 deletions, and to identify complex rearrangements that differ from the ones previously established by conventional cytogenetics.",
    "Subpallial Enhancer Transgenic Lines: a Data and Tool Resource to Study Transcriptional Regulation of GABAergic Cell Fate. Elucidating the transcriptional circuitry controlling forebrain development requires an understanding of\u00a0enhancer activity and regulation. We generated stable transgenic mouse lines that express CreER and GFP from ten different enhancer elements with activity in distinct domains within the embryonic basal ganglia. We used these unique tools to generate a comprehensive regional fate map of the mouse subpallium, including sources for specific subtypes of amygdala neurons. We then focused on deciphering transcriptional mechanisms that control enhancer activity. Using machine-learning computations, in\u00a0vivo chromosomal occupancy of 13 transcription factors that regulate subpallial patterning and differentiation and analysis of enhancer activity in Dlx1/2 and Lhx6 mutants, we elucidated novel molecular mechanisms that regulate region-specific enhancer activity in the developing brain. Thus, these subpallial enhancer transgenic lines are data and tool\u00a0resources to study transcriptional regulation of GABAergic cell fate.",
    "Suitability of [18F]altanserin and PET to determine 5-HT2A receptor availability in the rat brain: in vivo and in vitro validation of invasive and non-invasive kinetic models. PURPOSE: While the selective 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2a receptor (5-HT2AR) radiotracer [18F]altanserin is well established in humans, the present study evaluated its suitability for quantifying cerebral 5-HT2ARs with positron emission tomography (PET) in albino rats. PROCEDURES: Ten Sprague Dawley rats underwent 180 min PET scans with arterial blood sampling. Reference tissue methods were evaluated on the basis of invasive kinetic models with metabolite-corrected arterial input functions. In vivo 5-HT2AR quantification with PET was validated by in vitro autoradiographic saturation experiments in the same animals. RESULT: Overall brain uptake of [18F]altanserin was reliably quantified by invasive and non-invasive models with the cerebellum as reference region shown by linear correlation of outcome parameters. Unlike in humans, no lipophilic metabolites occurred so that brain activity derived solely from parent compound. PET data correlated very well with in vitro autoradiographic data of the same animals. CONCLUSION: [18F]Altanserin PET is a reliable tool for in vivo quantification of 5-HT2AR availability in albino rats. Models based on both blood input and reference tissue describe radiotracer kinetics adequately. Low cerebral tracer uptake might, however, cause restrictions in experimental usage.",

    "Sustained disease control in transplant-ineligible patients: the role of continuous therapy. Many patients with multiple myeloma (MM) are elderly (aged >65 years) or unfit, and therefore ineligible for stem-cell transplantation. The novel agents thalidomide, bortezomib, and lenalidomide have shown improved outcomes in these patients. This article discusses the role of continuous therapy in improving patient outcomes and how novel agents with better tolerability profiles could lead to a change in the treatment paradigm. According to the proposed concept, treatment of transplant-ineligible patients with MM should include achievement of high-quality responses with effective induction combination regimens, as well as maintenance of the response with long-term therapy for optimal sustained efficacy.",
    "Suvorexant: a dual orexin receptor antagonist for the treatment of sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia. OBJECTIVE: To review the efficacy, safety, and pharmacology data available for suvorexant and determine its role in therapy as compared with other agents available for the treatment of insomnia. DATA SOURCES: A PubMed search using the terms suvorexant and MK-4305 (the original name given to suvorexant during early trials) was conducted in December 2014 to identify initial literature sources. No time frame was used for exclusion of older trials. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Animal studies and trials written in a language other than English were excluded. Abstracts of the remaining trials were evaluated for determination of relevance to this review. References from these studies along with suvorexant prescriber information were used to identify additional literature. DATA SYNTHESIS: Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials were identified showing suvorexant to be safe, effective, and tolerable for the treatment of insomnia. After 4 weeks of therapy, relative to placebo, the 10- and 20-mg doses improved subjective total sleep time (22.3 and 49.9 minutes, respectively), wake after sleep onset (-21.4 and -28.1 minutes), and latency to persistent sleep (-2.3 and -22.3 minutes). CONCLUSION: Suvorexant is the first dual orexin receptor antagonist approved for the treatment of insomnia. Clinical trials have shown that it is relatively safe and effective for the treatment of both sleep onset and sleep maintenance at doses of 20 mg or less. Higher doses were studied but not approved because of concerns for next-day somnolence and effects on driving. Further studies are needed to assess this medication in patients with a history of addiction, because they were excluded from clinical trials, as well as to compare suvorexant with other insomnia medications available because no head-to-head studies have yet been conducted. However, its novel mechanism of action and theoretically lower addiction liability make suvorexant an appealing new option.",
    "Systemic RNAi in the small hive beetle Aethina tumida Murray (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae), a serious pest of the European honey bee Apis mellifera. BACKGROUND: Aethina tumida is a serious pest of the European honey bee (Apis mellifera) in North America and Australia. Here we investigate whether Laccase 2, the phenoloxidase gene essential for cuticle sclerotisation and pigmentation in many insects, and vacuolar-ATPase V-type subunit A, vital for the generation of proton gradients used to drive a range of transport processes, could be potential targets for RNAi-mediated control of A. tumida. RESULTS: Injection of V-ATPase subunit A (5 ng) and Laccase 2 (12.5 ng) dsRNAs resulted in 100% larval mortality, and qPCR confirmed significant decreases and enhanced suppression of transcript levels over time. Oral delivery of V-ATPase subunit A dsRNA in solutions resulted in 50% mortality; however, gene suppression could not be verified. We suggest that the inconsistent RNAi effect was a consequence of dsRNA degradation within the gut owing to the presence of extracellular nucleases. Target specificity was confirmed by a lack of effect on survival or gene expression in honey bees injected with A. tumida dsRNAs. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to show evidence for systemic RNAi in A. tumida in response to injected dsRNA, but further research is required to develop methods to induce RNAi effects via ingestion. \u00a9 2016 Crown copyright.

    "Systemic drugs that influence titanium implant osseointegration. Titanium implants are widely used on an increasing number of patients in orthopedic and dental medicine. Despite the good survival rates of these implants, failures that lead to important socio-economic consequences still exist. Recently, research aimed at improving implant fixation, a process called osseointegration, has focused on a new, innovative field: systemic delivery of drugs. Following implant fixation, patients receive systemic drugs that could either impair or enhance osseointegration; these drugs include anabolic and anti-catabolic bone-acting agents in addition to new treatments. Anabolic bone-acting agents include parathyroid hormone (PTH) peptides, simvastatin, prostaglandin EP4 receptor antagonist, vitamin D and strontium ranelate; anti-catabolic bone-acting agents include compounds like calcitonin, biphosphonates, RANK/RANKL/OPG system and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM). Examples of the new therapies include DKK1- and anti-sclerostin antibodies. All classes of treatments have proven to possess positive impacts such as an increase in bone mineral density and on osseointegration. In order to prevent complications from occurring after surgery, some post-operative systemic drugs are administered; these can show an impairment in the osseointegration process. These include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The effects of aspirin, acetaminophen, opioids, adjuvants, anticoagulants and antibiotics in implant fixations are not fully understood, but studies are being carried out to investigate potential ramifications. It is currently accepted that systemic pharmacological agents can either enhance or impair implant osseointegration; therefore, proper drug selection is essential. This review aims to discuss the varying effects of three different classes of treatments on improving this process.",
    "TBC1D7 is a third subunit of the TSC1-TSC2 complex upstream of mTORC1. The tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) tumor suppressors form the TSC1-TSC2 complex, which limits cell growth in response to poor growth conditions. Through its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity toward Rheb, this complex inhibits the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1), a key promoter of cell growth. Here, we identify and biochemically characterize TBC1D7 as a stably associated and ubiquitous third core subunit of the TSC1-TSC2 complex. We demonstrate that the TSC1-TSC2-TBC1D7 (TSC-TBC) complex is the functional complex that senses specific cellular growth conditions and possesses Rheb-GAP activity. Sequencing analyses of samples from TSC patients suggest that TBC1D7 is unlikely to represent TSC3. TBC1D7 knockdown decreases the association of TSC1 and TSC2 leading to decreased Rheb-GAP activity, without effects on the localization of TSC2 to the lysosome. Like the other TSC-TBC components, TBC1D7 knockdown results in increased mTORC1 signaling, delayed induction of autophagy, and enhanced cell growth under poor growth conditions.",
    "TMEM132: an ancient architecture of cohesin and immunoglobulin domains define a new family of neural adhesion molecules. Summary: The molecular functions of TMEM132 genes remain poorly understood and under-investigated despite their mutations associated with non-syndromic hearing loss, panic disorder and cancer. Here we show the full domain architecture of human TMEM132 family proteins solved using in-depth sequence and structural analysis. We reveal them to be five previously unappreciated cell adhesion molecules whose domain architecture has an early holozoan origin prior to the emergence of choanoflagellates and metazoa. The extra-cellular portions of TMEM132 proteins contain five conserved domains including three tandem immunoglobulin domains, and a cohesin domain homologue, the first such domain found in animals. These findings strongly predict a cellular adhesion function for TMEM132 family, connecting the extracellular medium with the intracellular actin cytoskeleton.

    "Tankyrase and the canonical Wnt pathway protect lung cancer cells from EGFR inhibition. Lung cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide. Adenocarcinomas, the most common histologic subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), are frequently associated with activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. Although these patients often respond clinically to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib, relapse inevitably occurs, suggesting the development of escape mechanisms that promote cell survival. Using a loss-of-function, whole genome short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen, we identified that the canonical Wnt pathway contributes to the maintenance of NSCLC cells during EGFR inhibition, particularly the poly-ADP-ribosylating enzymes tankyrase 1 and 2 that positively regulate canonical Wnt signaling. Inhibition of tankyrase and various other components of the Wnt pathway with shRNAs or small molecules significantly increased the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings therefore reveal a critical role for tankyrase and the canonical Wnt pathway in maintaining lung cancer cells during EGFR inhibition. Targeting the Wnt-tankyrase-\u03b2-catenin pathway together with EGFR inhibition may improve clinical outcome in patients with NSCLC.",
    "Targeting Intrinsic and Extrinsic Vulnerabilities for the Treatment of Multiple Myeloma. Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell disorder, clinically characterized by osteolytic lesions, immunodeficiency, and renal disease. Over the past decade, MM therapy is significantly improved by the introduction of novel therapeutics such as immunomodulatory agents (thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide), proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, carfilzomib, and ixazomib), monoclonal antibodies (daratumumab and elotuzumab), histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (Panobinostat). The clinical success of these agents has clearly identified vulnerabilities intrinsic to the MM cell, as well as targets that emanate from the tumor microenvironment. Despite these significant improvements, MM remains incurable due to the development of drug resistance. This perspective will discuss more recent strategies which take advantage of multiple targets within the proteome recycling pathway, chromatin remodeling, and disruption of nuclear export. In addition, we will review the development of strategies designed to block opportunistic survival signaling that occurs between the MM cell and the tumor microenvironment including strategies for inhibiting myeloma-induced immune suppression. It has become clear that MM tumors continue to evolve on therapy leading to drug resistance. It will be important to understand the emerging drug resistant mechanisms and additional vulnerabilities that occur due to the development of clinical resistance. J. Cell.

    "Targeting neuronal activity-regulated neuroligin-3 dependency in high-grade glioma. High-grade gliomas (HGG) are a devastating group of cancers, and represent the leading cause of brain tumour-related death in both children and adults. Therapies aimed at mechanisms intrinsic to glioma cells have translated to only limited success; effective therapeutic strategies will need also to target elements of the tumour microenvironment that promote glioma progression. Neuronal activity promotes the growth of a range of molecularly and clinically distinct HGG types, including adult and paediatric glioblastoma (GBM), anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). An important mechanism that mediates this neural regulation of brain cancer is activity-dependent cleavage and secretion of the synaptic adhesion molecule neuroligin-3 (NLGN3), which promotes glioma proliferation through the PI3K-mTOR pathway. However, the necessity of NLGN3 for glioma growth, the proteolytic mechanism of NLGN3 secretion, and the further molecular consequences of NLGN3 secretion in glioma cells remain unknown. Here we show that HGG growth depends on microenvironmental NLGN3, identify signalling cascades downstream of NLGN3 binding in glioma, and determine a therapeutically targetable mechanism of secretion. Patient-derived orthotopic xenografts of paediatric GBM, DIPG and adult GBM fail to grow in Nlgn3 knockout mice. NLGN3 stimulates several oncogenic pathways, such as early focal adhesion kinase activation upstream of PI3K-mTOR, and induces transcriptional changes that include upregulation of several synapse-related genes in glioma cells. NLGN3 is cleaved from both neurons and oligodendrocyte precursor cells via the ADAM10 sheddase. ADAM10 inhibitors prevent the release of NLGN3 into the tumour microenvironment and robustly block HGG xenograft growth. This work defines a promising strategy for targeting NLGN3 secretion, which could prove transformative for HGG therapy.",
    "Targeting the Genome-Stability Hub Ctf4 by Stapled-Peptide Design. The exploitation of synthetic lethality by small-molecule targeting of pathways that maintain genomic stability is an attractive chemotherapeutic approach. The Ctf4/AND-1 protein hub, which links DNA replication, repair, and chromosome segregation, represents a novel target for the synthetic lethality approach. Herein, we report the design, optimization, and validation of double-click stapled peptides encoding the Ctf4-interacting peptide (CIP) of the replicative helicase subunit Sld5. By screening stapling positions in the Sld5 CIP, we identified an unorthodox i,i+6 stapled peptide with improved, submicromolar binding to Ctf4. The mode of interaction with Ctf4 was confirmed by a crystal structure of the stapled Sld5 peptide bound to Ctf4. The stapled Sld5 peptide was able to displace the Ctf4 partner DNA polymerase \u03b1 from the replisome in yeast extracts. Our study provides proof-of-principle evidence for the development of small-molecule inhibitors of the human CTF4 orthologue AND-1.",
    "The Art and Science of Diagnosing and Managing Drug-induced Liver Injury in 2015 and Beyond. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) remains a leading reason why new compounds are dropped from further study or are the subject of product warnings and regulatory actions. Hy's Law of drug-induced hepatocellular jaundice causing a case-fatality rate or need for transplant of 10% or higher has been validated in several large national registries, including the ongoing, prospective U.S. Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network. It serves as the basis for stopping rules in clinical trials and in clinical practice. Because DILI can mimic all known causes of acute and chronic liver disease, establishing causality can be difficult. Histopathologic findings are often nonspecific and rarely, if ever, considered pathognomonic. A daily drug dose >50-100 mg is more likely to be hepatotoxic than does <10 mg, especially if the compound is highly lipophilic or undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism. The quest for a predictive biomarker to replace alanine aminotransferase is ongoing. Markers of necrosis and apoptosis such as microRNA-122 and keratin 18 may prove useful in identifying patients at risk for severe injury when they initially present with a suspected acetaminophen overdose. Although a number of drugs causing idiosyncratic DILI have HLA associations that may allow for pre-prescription testing to prevent hepatotoxicity, the cost and relatively low frequency of injury among affected patients limit the current usefulness of such genome-wide association studies. Alanine aminotransferase monitoring is often recommended but has rarely been shown to be an effective method to prevent serious DILI. Guidelines on the diagnosis and management of DILI have recently been published, although specific therapies remain limited. The LiverTox Web site has been introduced as an interactive online virtual textbook that makes the latest information on more than 650 agents available to clinicians, regulators, and drug developers alike.",

    "The Race of 10 Synthetic RNAi-Based Drugs to the Pharmaceutical Market. Ten years after Fire and Melo's Nobel Prize for discovery of gene silencing by double-stranded RNA, a remarkable progress was achieved in RNA interference (RNAi). Changes in the chemical structure of synthetic oligonucleotides make them more stable and specific, and new delivery strategies became progressively available. The attention of pharmaceutical industry rapidly turned to RNAi, as an opportunity to explore new drug targets. This review addresses nine small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and one unique microRNA (miRNA) inhibitor, which entered the phase 2-3 clinical trials. The siRNAs in focus are PF-04523655, TKM-080301, Atu027, SYL040012, SYL1001, siG12D-LODER (phase 2), QPI-1002, QPI-1007, and patisiran (phase 3). Regarding miRNAs, their content can be down- or up-regulated, by using miRNA inhibitors (AntimiRs) or miRNA mimics. Miravirsen is an AntimiR-122 for hepatitis C virus infection. The flexibility of RNAi technology is easily understood taking into account: (i) the different drug targets (i.e. p53, caspase 2, PKN3, \u03b22-adrenergic receptor, mutated KRAS, microRNAs); (ii) therapeutic conditions, including ophthalmic diseases, kidney injury, amyloidosis, pancreatic cancer, viral hepatitis; and (iii) routes of administration (ocular, intravenous, subcutaneous, intratumoral). Although some issues are still matters of concern (delivery, toxicity, cost, and biological barriers), RNAi definitively opens a wide avenue for drug development.",
    "The SF-36 Offers a Strong Measure of Mental Health Symptoms in Survivors of Acute Respiratory Failure. A Tri-National Analysis. RATIONALE: Survivors of acute respiratory failure commonly experience long-term psychological sequelae and impaired quality of life. For researchers interested in general mental health, using multiple condition-specific instruments may be unnecessary and inefficient when using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF)-36, a recommended outcome measure, may suffice. However, relationships between the SF-36 scores and commonly used measures of psychological symptoms in acute survivors of respiratory failure are unknown. OBJECTIVES: Our objective is to examine the relationship of the SF-36 mental health domain (MH) and mental health component summary (MCS) scores with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) evaluated using validated psychological instruments. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 1,229 participants at 6- and 12-month follow-up assessment using data from five studies from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Depression Anxiety Stress Scales, the Davidson Trauma Scale, Impact of Event Scale (IES), and IES-Revised (IES-R). At 6-month assessment there were moderate to strong correlations of the SF-36 MH scores with HADS depression and anxiety symptoms (r = -0.74 and -0.79) and with IES-R PTSD symptoms (r = -0.60) in the pooled analyses. Using the normalized population mean of 50 on the SF-36 MH domain score as a cut-off, positive predictive values were 16 and 55% for substantial depression; 20 and 68% for substantial anxiety (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales and HADS, respectively); and 40, 44, and 67% for substantial PTSD symptoms (IES-R, IES, and Davidson Trauma Scale, respectively). Negative predictive values were high. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of the SF-36 MH score was high for depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms (0.88, 0.91, and 0.84, respectively). All results were consistent for the MCS, across the individual studies, and for the 12-month assessment. CONCLUSIONS: For researchers interested in general mental health status, the SF-36 MH or MCS offers a strong measure of psychological symptoms prevalent among survivors of acute respiratory failure. For researchers interested in specific conditions, validated psychological instruments should be considered.",
    "The Secreted Enzyme PM20D1 Regulates Lipidated Amino Acid Uncouplers of Mitochondria. Brown and beige adipocytes are specialized cells that express uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and dissipate chemical energy as heat. These cells likely possess alternative UCP1-independent thermogenic mechanisms. Here, we identify a secreted enzyme, peptidase M20 domain containing 1 (PM20D1), that is enriched in UCP1(+) versus UCP1(-) adipocytes. We\u00a0demonstrate that PM20D1 is a bidirectional enzyme in\u00a0vitro, catalyzing both the condensation of fatty acids and amino acids to generate N-acyl amino acids and also the reverse hydrolytic reaction. N-acyl amino acids directly bind mitochondria and function as endogenous uncouplers of UCP1-independent respiration. Mice with increased circulating PM20D1 have augmented respiration and increased N-acyl amino acids in blood. Lastly, administration of N-acyl amino acids to mice improves glucose homeostasis and increases energy expenditure. These data identify an enzymatic node and a family of metabolites that regulate energy homeostasis. This pathway might be useful for treating obesity and associated disorders.",

    "The activation of the decapping enzyme DCP2 by DCP1 occurs on the EDC4 scaffold and involves a conserved loop in DCP1. The removal of the 5'-cap structure by the decapping enzyme DCP2 and its coactivator DCP1 shuts down translation and exposes the mRNA to 5'-to-3' exonucleolytic degradation by XRN1. Although yeast DCP1 and DCP2 directly interact, an additional factor, EDC4, promotes DCP1-DCP2 association in metazoan. Here, we elucidate how the human proteins interact to assemble an active decapping complex and how decapped mRNAs are handed over to XRN1. We show that EDC4 serves as a scaffold for complex assembly, providing binding sites for DCP1, DCP2 and XRN1. DCP2 and XRN1 bind simultaneously to the EDC4 C-terminal domain through short linear motifs (SLiMs). Additionally, DCP1 and DCP2 form direct but weak interactions that are facilitated by EDC4. Mutational and functional studies indicate that the docking of DCP1 and DCP2 on the EDC4 scaffold is a critical step for mRNA decapping in vivo. They also revealed a crucial role for a conserved asparagine-arginine containing loop (the NR-loop) in the DCP1 EVH1 domain in DCP2 activation. Our data indicate that DCP2 activation by DCP1 occurs preferentially on the EDC4 scaffold, which may serve to couple DCP2 activation by DCP1 with 5'-to-3' mRNA degradation by XRN1 in human cells.",
    "The antibody aducanumab reduces A\u03b2 plaques in Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, accompanied by synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Antibody-based immunotherapy against A\u03b2 to trigger its clearance or mitigate its neurotoxicity has so far been unsuccessful. Here we report the generation of aducanumab, a human monoclonal antibody that selectively targets aggregated A\u03b2. In a transgenic mouse model of AD, aducanumab is shown to enter the brain, bind parenchymal A\u03b2, and reduce soluble and insoluble A\u03b2 in a dose-dependent manner. In patients with prodromal or mild AD, one year of monthly intravenous infusions of aducanumab reduces brain A\u03b2 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This is accompanied by a slowing of clinical decline measured by Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes and Mini Mental State Examination scores. The main safety and tolerability findings are amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. These results justify further development of aducanumab for the treatment of AD. Should the slowing of clinical decline be confirmed in ongoing phase 3 clinical trials, it would provide compelling support for the amyloid hypothesis.",
    "The antioxidant enzyme peroxiredoxin-2 is depleted in lymphocytes seven days after ultra-endurance exercise. PURPOSE: Peroxiredoxin-2 (PRDX-2) is an antioxidant and chaperone-like protein critical for cell function. This study examined whether the levels of lymphocyte PRDX-2 are altered over 1 month following ultra-endurance exercise. METHODS: Nine middle-aged men undertook a single-stage, multi-day 233 km (145 mile) ultra-endurance running race. Blood was collected immediately before (Pre), upon completion/retirement (Post), and following the race at Day 1, Day 7 and Day 28. Lymphocyte lysates were examined for PRDX-2 by reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE with western blotting. In a sub-group of men who completed the race (n = 4), PRDX-2 oligomeric state (indicative of redox status) was investigated. RESULTS: Ultra-endurance exercise caused significant changes in lymphocyte PRDX-2 (F(4,32) 3.409, p = 0.020, \u03b7(2) = 0.299): 7 days after the race, PRDX-2 levels in lymphocytes had fallen to 30% of pre-race values (p = 0.013) and returned to near-normal levels at Day 28. Non-reducing gels demonstrated that dimeric PRDX-2 (intracellular reduced PRDX-2 monomers) was increased in three of four race completers immediately post-race, indicative of an 'antioxidant response'. Moreover, monomeric PRDX-2 was also increased immediately post-race in two of four race-completing subjects, indicative of oxidative damage, which was not detectable by Day 7. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphocyte PRDX-2 was decreased below normal levels 7 days after ultra-endurance exercise. Excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species induced by ultra-endurance exercise may underlie depletion of lymphocyte PRDX-2 by triggering its turnover after oxidation. Low levels of lymphocyte PRDX-2 could influence cell function and might, in part, explain reports of dysregulated immunity following ultra-endurance exercise.",
    "The beet Y locus encodes an anthocyanin MYB-like protein that activates the betalain red pigment pathway. Nearly all flowering plants produce red/violet anthocyanin pigments. Caryophyllales is the only order containing families that replace anthocyanins with unrelated red and yellow betalain pigments. Close biological correlation of pigmentation patterns suggested that betalains might be regulated by a conserved anthocyanin-regulating transcription factor complex consisting of a MYB, a bHLH and a WD repeat-containing protein (the MBW complex). Here we show that a previously uncharacterized anthocyanin MYB-like protein, Beta vulgaris MYB1 (BvMYB1), regulates the betalain pathway in beets. Silencing BvMYB1 downregulates betalain biosynthetic genes and pigmentation, and overexpressing BvMYB1 upregulates them. However, unlike anthocyanin MYBs, BvMYB1 will not interact with bHLH members of heterologous anthocyanin MBW complexes because of identified nonconserved residues. BvMYB1 resides at the historic beet pigment-patterning locus, Y, required for red-fleshed beets. We show that Y and y express different levels of BvMYB1 transcripts. The co-option of a transcription factor regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis would be an important evolutionary event allowing betalains to largely functionally replace anthocyanins.",
    "The development of dasatinib as a treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML): from initial studies to application in newly diagnosed patients. PURPOSE: Dasatinib is a dual Abl/Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) designed as a prototypic short-acting BCR-ABL-targeted TKI that inhibits BCR-ABL with greater potency compared with imatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib and has been shown to have potential immunomodulatory effects. Dasatinib is approved for the treatment of all phases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia resistant or intolerant to prior imatinib treatment and first-line treatment for CML in chronic phase. In this article, the development of dasatinib as a treatment for patients with CML is reviewed. METHODS: This is a review of the relevant literature regarding dasatinib development in CML (2003-2013). RESULTS: Dasatinib demonstrates efficacy against most BCR-ABL mutations arising during imatinib therapy and is effective in treating patients with imatinib resistance due to other mechanisms. Randomized trial data show that first-line dasatinib provides superior responses compared with imatinib and enables patients to achieve early, deep responses correlated with improved longer-term outcomes. Dasatinib has a generally acceptable safety profile, with most adverse events (AEs) proving manageable and reversible. Cytopenias are commonly observed with dasatinib, and some nonhematologic AEs including pleural effusion have been consistently reported. CONCLUSION: Dasatinib is an effective treatment option for patients with CML.",
    "The dopamine transporter is decreased in the striatum of subjects with restless legs syndrome. STUDY OBJECTIVES: Prior studies, all using SPECT techniques, failed to find any differences for dopamine transporter (DAT) in restless legs syndrome (RLS) subjects. The distinct pharmacokinetic properties associated with SPECT-determined DAT along with rapid biodynamic changes in DAT may, however, have missed membrane-bound DAT differences. The current studies assessed real-time DAT binding potentials (BP) in striatum of RLS patients using (11)C-methylphenidate and PET techniques. DESIGN: RLS medications were stopped at least 11 days prior to the PET study. Clinical severity of RLS was also assessed. PET scans were performed at 2 different times of day (starting at 08:30 and 19:30) in separate groups of subjects. The primary outcome measure was total striatal DAT BP. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six patients with primary RLS and 34 age- and gender-matched controls. RESULTS: RLS subjects had significantly lower DAT binding in the striatum compared to controls on both the Day and the Night scans. DAT was decreased in putamen and caudate but not the ventral striatum of RLS subjects. There were no diurnal differences in DAT for the total group or for control and RLS separately. DAT BP did not correlate with any clinical measures of RLS. CONCLUSION: The current study found a significant decrease in DAT BP in two independent studies. These results when viewed along with prior RLS SPECT and autopsy studies of DAT, and cell culture studies with iron deficiency and DAT, suggest that membrane-bound striatal DAT, but not total cellular DAT, may be decreased in RLS.",
    "The emerging role of p53 in exercise metabolism. The major tumour suppressor protein, p53, is one of the most well-studied proteins in cell biology. Often referred to as the Guardian of the Genome, the list of known functions of p53 include regulatory roles in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, angiogenesis, DNA repair and cell senescence. More recently, p53 has been implicated as a key molecular player regulating substrate metabolism and exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle. In this context, the study of p53 therefore has obvious implications for both human health and performance, given that impaired mitochondrial content and function is associated with the pathology of many metabolic disorders such as ageing, type 2 diabetes, obesity and cancer, as well as reduced exercise performance. Studies on p53 knockout (KO) mice collectively demonstrate that ablation of p53 content reduces intermyofibrillar (IMF) and subsarcolemmal (SS) mitochondrial yield, reduces cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1-\u03b1 protein content whilst also reducing mitochondrial respiration and increasing reactive oxygen species production during state 3 respiration in IMF mitochondria. Additionally, p53 KO mice exhibit marked reductions in exercise capacity (in the magnitude of 50 %) during fatiguing swimming, treadmill running and electrical stimulation protocols. p53 may regulate contractile-induced increases in mitochondrial content via modulating mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) content and/or activity, given that p53 KO mice display reduced skeletal muscle mitochondrial DNA, Tfam messenger RNA and protein levels. Furthermore, upon muscle contraction, p53 is phosphorylated on serine 15 and subsequently translocates to the mitochondria where it forms a complex with Tfam to modulate expression of mitochondrial-encoded subunits of the COX complex. In human skeletal muscle, the exercise-induced phosphorylation of p53(Ser15) is enhanced in conditions of reduced carbohydrate availability in association with enhanced upstream signalling through 5'adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase but not p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. In this way, undertaking regular exercise in carbohydrate restricted states may therefore be a practical approach to achieve the physiological benefits of consistent p53 signalling. Although our knowledge of p53 in exercise metabolism has advanced considerably, much of our current understanding of p53 regulation and associated targets is derived from various non-muscle cells and tissues. As such, many fundamental questions remain unanswered in contracting skeletal muscle. Detailed studies concerning the time-course of p53 activation (including additional post-translational modifications and subsequent subcellular translocation), as well as the effects of exercise modality (endurance versus resistance), intensity, duration, fibre type, age, training status and nutrient availability, must now be performed so that we can optimise exercise prescription guidelines to strategically target p53 signalling. The emerging role of p53 in skeletal muscle metabolism therefore represents a novel and exciting research area for exercise and muscle physiologists.",
    "The first case report of McLeod syndrome in a Chinese patient. We report the first case of McLeod syndrome (MLS) in a 47-year-old Chinese man who presented with progressive limb weakness, chorea of feet, red blood cell acanthocytosis, absence of Kx red blood cell antigen and weak expression of Kell antigens. The diagnosis of MLS was confirmed by genetic testing showing a hemizygous mutation of XK gene. We review literature on neuroacanthocytosis in the Chinese population.",
    "The glial sodium-calcium exchanger: a new target for nitric oxide-mediated cellular toxicity. The plasma membrane Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) is a bidirectional ion transporter that couples the translocation of Na(+) in one direction with that of Ca(2+) in the opposite direction. This system contributes to the regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration via the forward mode (Ca(2+) efflux) or the reverse mode (Ca(2+) influx). We have previously demonstrated that the Ca(2+) paradox, an in vitro reperfusion model, causes the sustained activation of the reverse mode of the NCX, the disruption of Ca(2+) homeostasis, and subsequent delayed apoptotic-like death in astrocytes. In addition, we found that the nitric oxide (NO)-cyclic GMP signaling pathway inhibits Ca(2+) paradox-mediated astrocyte apoptosis, while a high concentration of NO induces cytotoxicity. In this way, Ca(2+) and NO may work together in the pathogenesis of several cells in the central nervous system. Concerning the role of NCX in NO cytotoxicity, we have found, using the specific inhibitor of NCX 2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl)methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline (SEA0400), that NCX is involved in NO-induced cytotoxicity in cultured microglia, astrocytes, and neuronal cells. This review summarizes the pathological roles of the NCX as a new target for NO-mediated cellular toxicity, based on our studies on NO-NCX-mediated glial toxicity.",
    "The golden jubilee of vaccination against poliomyelitis. Inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), developed in the USA by Jonas Salk in the early 1950s, was field tested in 1954, and found to be safe and effective. The year 2004 marks the golden jubilee of this breakthrough. From 1955 IPV was used extensively in the US and polio incidence declined by more than 95 per cent. However, in 1962, when oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) became available, the national policy was shifted to its exclusive use, for reasons other than science and economics. The World Health Organisation (WHO) also adopted the policy of the exclusive use of OPV in developing countries. Thus IPV fell into disrepute in much of the world, while Northern European countries continued to use it. New research led to improving its potency, reducing its manufacturing costs and combining it with the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine to simplify its administration and reduce programmatic costs. All countries that chose to persist with IPV eliminated poliovirus circulation without OPV-induced polio or the risk of live vaccine viruses reverting to wild-like nature. IPV is highly immunogenic, confers mucosal immunity and exerts herd protective effect, all qualities of a good vaccine. It can be used in harmony with the extendend programme on immunization (EPI) schedule of infant immunisation with DTP, thus reducing programmatic costs. During the last ten years IPV has once again regained its popularity and some 25 industrialised countries use it exclusively. The demand is increasing from other countries and the supply has not caught up, leaving market forces to dictate the sale price of IPV. Anticipating such a turn of events India had launched its own IPV manufacturing programme in 1987, but the project was closed in 1992. Today it is not clear if we can complete the job of global polio eradication without IPV, on account of the genetic instability of OPV and the consequent tendency of vaccine viruses to revert to wild-like properties. The option to use IPV is complicated since it is not yet licensed in India, we do not manufacture it and imported vaccine would be prohibitively costly. However, in this golden jubilee year we have much to celebrate as the global eradication of wild polioviruses is within sight. Had we strictly followed the principles of science and health economics, perhaps we could have achieved success earlier and cheaper, with the absence of vaccine-induced polio as the bonus.",
    "The importance of IgG4 in the predictive model of thyroiditis. UNLABELLED: Immunoglobulin (Ig)G4-related sclerosing disease (IgG4-RSD) is a new disease entity first proposed with regard to autoimmune pancreatitis. A 67-year-old male patient was examined because of weight loss and an abdominal pain. Based on the clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters and ultrasound features, we identified the diagnosis of the IgG4-related systemic disease (IgG4-RSD), that was confirmed by the histopathological analysis after the biopsy of the head of pancreas. After confirmation, we started with the corticosteroid therapy with a good clinical, biochemical and morphological response. During the previous therapy, the disturbance of glucoregulation appeared, so we had to change the modality of treatment. We decided to add Azathioprine to the therapy in a dose of 150 mg/day. We achieved a stable phase of the disease with IgG 4.37 g/l and IgG4 0.179 g/l, and with no side effects from the therapy. LEARNING POINTS: There are potential clinical applications of identifying subsets of patients with IgG4 thyroiditis (FVHT and Riedel thyroiditis).A trial of immunosuppressive therapy should be included if a resection is deemed inadvisable.In particular, cases of FVHT that mimic malignancy, tissue and serum IgG4 may provide supportive diagnostic information.",
    "The incidence of cystic fibrosis in Caucasian populations. Estimates of the newborn frequency of cystic fibrosis in different Caucasian groups range from 4 times more to 40 times less common than the generally accepted figure of 1:2000. Current meconium screening trials which may be effective in populations with the incidence equal to or greater than 1:2000, may be useful for populations with an incidence as low as 1:7000 only after maximum improvement of the methods. Once the true incidence or the variable incidence is proven for Caucasian populations, screening trails in Negro, Oriental and Indian populations will be required.",
    "The long QT syndrome: a novel missense mutation in the S6 region of the KVLQT1 gene. The Romano Ward long QT syndrome (LQTS) has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Patients suffer from syncopal attacks often resulting in sudden cardiac death. The main diagnostic parameter is a prolonged QT(c) interval as judged by electro-cardiographic investigation. LQTS is a genetically heterogeneous disease with four loci having been identified to date: chromosome 11p15.5 (LQT1), 7q35-36 (LQT2), 3p21-24 (LQT3) and 4q25-26 (LQT4). The corresponding genes code for potassium channels KVLQT1 (LQT1) and HERG (LQT2) and the sodium channel SCN5A (LQT3). The KVLQT1 gene is characterized by six transmembrane domains (S1-S6), a pore region situated between the S5 and S6 domains and a C-terminal domain accounting for approximately 60% of the channel. This domain is thought to be co-associated with another protein, viz. minK (minimal potassium channel). We have studied a Romano Ward family with several affected individuals showing a severe LQTS phenotype (syncopes and occurrence of sudden death). Most affected individuals had considerable prolongations of QT(c). By using haplotyping with a set of markers covering the four LQT loci, strong linkage was established to the LQT1 locus, whereas the other loci (LQT2, LQT3 and LQT4) could be excluded. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing were used to screen the KVLQT1 gene for mutations in the S1-S6 region, including the pore domain. We identified a Gly-216-Arg substitution in the S6 transmembrane domain of KVLQT1. The mutation was present in all affected family members but absent in normal control individuals, providing evidence that the mutated KVLQT1-gene product indeed caused LQTS in this family. The mutated KVLQT1-gene product thus probably results in a dominant negative suppression of channel activity.",
    "The mTOR pathway controls cell proliferation by regulating the FoxO3a transcription factor via SGK1 kinase. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) functions as a component of two large complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, which play crucial roles in regulating cell growth and homeostasis. However, the molecular mechanisms by which mTOR controls cell proliferation remain elusive. Here we show that the FoxO3a transcription factor is coordinately regulated by mTORC1 and mTORC2, and plays a crucial role in controlling cell proliferation. To dissect mTOR signaling, mTORC1 was specifically inactivated by depleting p18, an essential anchor of mTORC1 on lysosomes. mTORC1 inactivation caused a marked retardation of cell proliferation, which was associated with upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs). Although Akt was activated by mTORC1 inactivation, FoxO3a was upregulated via an epigenetic mechanism and hypophosphorylated at Ser314, which resulted in its nuclear accumulation. Consistently, mTORC1 inactivation induced downregulation of serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1), the kinase responsible for Ser314 phosphorylation. Expression of FoxO3a mutated at Ser314 suppressed cell proliferation by inducing CDKI expression. SGK1 overexpression suppressed CDKI expression in p18-deficient cells, whereas SGK1 knockdown induced CDKI expression in wild-type cells, resulting in the suppression of cell proliferation. These results suggest that mTORC1, in coordination with mTORC2, controls cell proliferation by regulating FoxO3a gene expression and SGK1-mediated phosphorylation of FoxO3a at Ser314.",
    "The organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3) as molecular target of psychotropic drugs: transport characteristics and acute regulation of cloned murine OCT3. The organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3) is a widely expressed transporter for endogenous and exogenous organic cations. Of particular interest is OCT3 expression and function in the brain, where it plays a role in serotonin clearance and influences mood and behavior. Protein kinase signaling mediates rapid modulation of cerebral processes, but little is known about acute regulation of OCT3 by protein kinases. Therefore, we cloned mouse OCT3 (mOCT3) and generated a human embryonic kidney cell line stably expressing the transporter to study transport characteristics, acute regulation by protein kinases, and interaction with psychotropic drugs. Uptake measurement was performed using the fluorescent cation 4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium iodide (ASP(+), 1\u00a0\u03bcM) as a substrate. The translational value of these findings was determined by comparing results obtained with cloned mouse and human OCT3. mOCT3-mediated transport is membrane potential dependent and pH independent. ASP(+) uptake by mOCT3 and human OCT3 (hOCT3) was efficiently inhibited by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, tetrapentylammonium (TPA(+)), corticosterone, serotonin, and histamine and by the drugs ketamine, fluoxetine, and diazepam. The half maximal inhibitory concentrations of mOCT3 and hOCT3 for TPA(+), serotonin, diazepam, and ketamine are significantly different. Diazepam is a non-transported inhibitor. Furthermore, the activities of mOCT3 and hOCT3 are acutely regulated by the p56 (lck) tyrosine kinase by decreasing their V max. Studies with freshly isolated renal proximal tubules from mOCT1/2(-/-) mice, in which mOCT3 is the only OCT present, confirmed this regulation pathway. Only the activity of hOCT3 is regulated by calmodulin. These findings suggest that even though many transport properties of mOCT3 and hOCT3 are similar, there are also species-specific aspects of OCT3 function.",
    "The origin of mitochondria in light of a fluid prokaryotic chromosome model. Biologists agree that the ancestor of mitochondria was an alpha-proteobacterium. But there is no consensus as to what constitutes an alpha-proteobacterial gene. Is it a gene found in all or several alpha-proteobacteria, or in only one? Here, we examine the proportion of alpha-proteobacterial genes in alpha-proteobacterial genomes by means of sequence comparisons. We find that each alpha-proteobacterium harbours a particular collection of genes and that, depending upon the lineage examined, between 97 and 33% are alpha-proteobacterial by the nearest-neighbour criterion. Our findings bear upon attempts to reconstruct the mitochondrial ancestor and upon inferences concerning the collection of genes that the mitochondrial ancestor possessed at the time that it became an endosymbiont.",
    "The p53-binding protein 1-Tudor-interacting repair regulator complex participates in the DNA damage response. The 53BP1-dependent end-joining pathway plays a critical role in double strand break repair and is uniquely responsible for cellular sensitivity to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) in BRCA1-deficient cancers. We and others have investigated the downstream effectors of 53BP1, including replication timing regulatory factor 1 (RIF1) and Pax transactivation domain-interacting protein (PTIP), in the past few years to elucidate how loss of the 53BP1-dependent repair pathway results in PARPi resistance in BRCA1 patients. However, questions regarding the upstream regulation of the 53BP1 pathway remain unanswered. In this study, we identified the Tudor-interacting repair regulator (TIRR) that specifically associates with the ionizing radiation-induced foci formation region of 53BP1. 53BP1 and TIRR form a stable complex, which is required for their expression. Moreover, the 53BP1-TIRR complex dissociates after DNA damage, and this dissociation may be ataxia telangiectasia mutated-dependent. Similar to 53BP1, loss of TIRR restores PARPi resistance in BRCA1-deficient cells. Collectively, our data identified a novel 53BP1-TIRR complex in DNA damage response. TIRR may play both positive and negative roles in 53BP1 regulation. On the one hand, it stabilizes 53BP1 and thus positively regulates 53BP1. On the other hand, its association with 53BP1 prevents 53BP1 localization to sites of DNA damage, and thus TIRR is also an inhibitor of 53BP1.",
    "The pentapeptide LQVVR plays a pivotal role in human cystatin C fibrillization. Human cystatin C (HCC) is a low molecular weight member of the cystatin family (type2). HCC consists of 120 amino acids. Normally it is an inhibitor of cysteine proteases, but in pathological conditions it forms amyloid fibrils in brain arteries of young adults. An 'aggregation-prone' pentapeptide ((47)LQVVR(51)) was located within the HCC sequence using AmylPred, an 'aggregation-prone' peptide prediction algorithm developed in our lab. This peptide was synthesized and self-assembled into amyloid-like fibrils in vitro, as electron microscopy, X-ray fiber diffraction, Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier-Transform Spectroscopy and Congo red staining studies reveal. Thus, the (47)LQVVR(51) peptide seems to have an important role in HCC fibrillization.",
    "The pharmacoepidemiology of antipsychotics for adults with schizophrenia in Canada, 2005 to 2009. OBJECTIVE: To describe the frequency and trends in the use of antipsychotics for adults with schizophrenia in Canada from 2005 to 2009. METHODS: Analyses were performed on IMS Brogan's Canadian Disease and Therapeutic Index (CDTI). The CDTI is a national physician panel study consisting of a representative sample of physicians both geographically and by specialty. Weighting adjustments are made to estimate national drug recommendations. Quarterly, panel physicians record all therapeutic recommendations during a 2-day period, including patient age, sex, and indication. Antipsychotic recommendations were estimated using CDTI data in which schizophrenia was listed as the indication. RESULTS: First-generation antipsychotic (FGA) recommendations for adults with schizophrenia increased by 38% between 2005 and 2009, from 329 380 to 454 960 recommendations. There were notable increases in recommendations for chlorpromazine, loxapine, zuclopenthixol, and flupentixol. Second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) recommendations increased to a much lesser extent (9%), which was mostly attributable to an increase in recommendations for clozapine. Drug recommendations for olanzapine decreased by 9%. CONCLUSION: The rate of increase of FGA use is now greater than that of SGAs. This may be due to data from recent comparative trials, which suggest that clinical efficacy, and the rate of neurological side effects is similar between FGAs and SGAs. The decreasing use of olanzapine may be due to metabolic adverse effects. The increased use of clozapine may be due to data on its superiority in patients who are treatment resistant.",
    "The physiological target for LeuRS translational quality control is norvaline. The fidelity of protein synthesis depends on the capacity of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs) to couple only cognate amino acid-tRNA pairs. If amino acid selectivity is compromised, fidelity can be ensured by an inherent AARS editing activity that hydrolyses mischarged tRNAs. Here, we show that the editing activity of Escherichia coli leucyl-tRNA synthetase (EcLeuRS) is not required to prevent incorrect isoleucine incorporation. Rather, as shown by kinetic, structural and in vivo approaches, the prime biological function of LeuRS editing is to prevent mis-incorporation of the non-standard amino acid norvaline. This conclusion follows from a reassessment of the discriminatory power of LeuRS against isoleucine and the demonstration that a LeuRS editing-deficient E. coli strain grows normally in high concentrations of isoleucine but not under oxygen deprivation conditions when norvaline accumulates to substantial levels. Thus, AARS-based translational quality control is a key feature for bacterial adaptive response to oxygen deprivation. The non-essential role for editing under normal bacterial growth has important implications for the development of resistance to antimicrobial agents targeting the LeuRS editing site.",
    "The proteome of the calcified layer organic matrix of turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) eggshell. BACKGROUND: Chicken eggshell mineralization is a prominent model for biomineralization not only because of its importance for avian reproduction but also because of the commercial interest associated with eggshell quality. An analysis and comparison of the protein constituents of eggshells of several species would contribute to a better understanding of the shell mineralization process. The recent publication of the turkey genome sequence now provides a basis for the in-depth analysis of the turkey eggshell proteome. RESULTS: Proteomic analysis of turkey acid-soluble and acid-insoluble organic eggshell matrix yielded 697 identified proteins/protein groups. However, intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) results indicated that the 47 most abundant identified proteins already constituted 95% of the total turkey eggshell matrix proteome. Forty-four of these proteins were also identified in chicken eggshell matrix previously. Despite these similarities there were important and unexpected differences. While ovocleidin-116 and ovocalyxin-36 were major proteins constituting approximately 37% of the identified proteome, other members of the group of so-called eggshell-specific proteins were not identified. Thus ovocalyxin-21 and ovocalyxin-32 were missing among matrix proteins. Conversely, major turkey eggshell proteins were not detected in chicken, such as the bone protein periostin, the mammalian counterpart of which is involved in many aspects of bone metabolism and which represented 10-11% of the total identified proteome. CONCLUSIONS: Even members of the same avian family show important differences in eggshell matrix composition and more studies on the proteome and the transcriptome level will be necessary to identify a common toolkit of eggshell mineralization and to work out species differences among functional eggshell protein sets and their role in eggshell production.",
    "The role of DNA methylation in directing the functional organization of the cancer epigenome. The holistic role of DNA methylation in the organization of the cancer epigenome is not well understood. Here we perform a comprehensive, high-resolution analysis of chromatin structure to compare the landscapes of HCT116 colon cancer cells and a DNA methylation-deficient derivative. The NOMe-seq accessibility assay unexpectedly revealed symmetrical and transcription-independent nucleosomal phasing across active, poised, and inactive genomic elements. DNA methylation abolished this phasing primarily at enhancers and CpG island (CGI) promoters, with little effect on insulators and non-CGI promoters. Abolishment of DNA methylation led to the context-specific reestablishment of the poised and active states of normal colon cells, which were marked in methylation-deficient cells by distinct H3K27 modifications and the presence of either well-phased nucleosomes or nucleosome-depleted regions, respectively. At higher-order genomic scales, we found that long, H3K9me3-marked domains had lower accessibility, consistent with a more compact chromatin structure. Taken together, our results demonstrate the nuanced and context-dependent role of DNA methylation in the functional, multiscale organization of cancer epigenomes.",
    "The role of LOX and LOXL2 in scar formation after glaucoma surgery. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of lysyl oxidase (LOX) and lysyl oxidase like (LOXL) 2 in pathologic wound healing after glaucoma surgery. We therefore investigated the expression of LOX and LOXL2 and evaluated the therapeutic potential of anti-LOX (GS-639556, formerly M64) and anti-LOXL2 (GS-607601, formerly AB0023) antibodies in a rabbit model of glaucoma trabeculectomy. METHODS: Ocular expression of LOX and LOXL2 was investigated by immunohistologic staining at different time points after trabeculectomy. Treatment with GS-639556 or GS-607601 was initiated in rabbits immediately after trabeculectomy by giving both intracameral and subconjunctival injections. Thereafter, the antibodies were given twice a week subconjunctivally until day 30 after surgery (day of euthanization). Treatment outcome was studied by clinical investigation of the bleb and by immunohistochemical analysis of angiogenesis, inflammation, and collagen deposition. RESULTS: LOX and LOXL2 were both upregulated in Tenon's capsule and the conjunctiva after glaucoma surgery. Repeated administration of LOX- or LOXL2-targeting monoclonal antibodies increased bleb area and bleb survival. Analyses of immunohistologic stainings showed that both antibodies significantly decreased fibrosis, whereas the anti-LOXL2 antibody also significantly reduced blood vessel density and inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting LOXL2 with an inhibitory monoclonal antibody (GS-607601) reduced pathologic angiogenesis, inflammation, and fibrosis. These results suggest that LOXL2 could be an appealing target for treatment of scar formation after glaucoma surgery, and point to the potential therapeutic benefits of simtuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody derived from GS-607601.",
    "The role of SMARCAL1 in replication fork stability and telomere maintenance. SMARCAL1 (SWI/SNF Related, Matrix Associated, Actin Dependent Regulator Of Chromatin, Subfamily A-Like 1), also known as HARP, is an ATP-dependent annealing helicase that stabilizes replication forks during DNA damage. Mutations in this gene are the cause of Schimke immune-osseous dysplasia (SIOD), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by T-cell immunodeficiency and growth dysfunctions. In this review, we summarize the main roles of SMARCAL1 in DNA repair, telomere maintenance and replication fork stability in response to DNA replication stress.",
    "The telomerase inhibitor imetelstat alone, and in combination with trastuzumab, decreases the cancer stem cell population and self-renewal of HER2+ breast cancer cells. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are thought to be responsible for tumor progression, metastasis, and recurrence. HER2 overexpression is associated with increased CSCs, which may explain the aggressive phenotype and increased likelihood of recurrence for HER2(+) breast cancers. Telomerase is reactivated in tumor cells, including CSCs, but has limited activity in normal tissues, providing potential for telomerase inhibition in anti-cancer therapy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a telomerase antagonistic oligonucleotide, imetelstat (GRN163L), on CSC and non-CSC populations of HER2(+) breast cancer cell lines. The effects of imetelstat on CSC populations of HER2(+) breast cancer cells were measured by ALDH activity and CD44/24 expression by flow cytometry as well as mammosphere assays for functionality. Combination studies in vitro and in vivo were utilized to test for synergism between imetelstat and trastuzumab. Imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in both subpopulations. Moreover, imetelstat alone and in combination with trastuzumab reduced the CSC fraction and inhibited CSC functional ability, as shown by decreased mammosphere counts and invasive potential. Tumor growth rate was slower in combination-treated mice compared to either drug alone. Additionally, there was a trend toward decreased CSC marker expression in imetelstat-treated xenograft cells compared to vehicle control. Furthermore, the observed decrease in CSC marker expression occurred prior to and after telomere shortening, suggesting that imetelstat acts on the CSC subpopulation in telomere length-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Our study suggests addition of imetelstat to trastuzumab may enhance the effects of HER2 inhibition therapy, especially in the CSC population.",
    "The transcription factor TFIIS zinc ribbon dipeptide Asp-Glu is critical for stimulation of elongation and RNA cleavage by RNA polymerase II. The eukaryotic transcription factor TFIIS enhances elongation and nascent transcript cleavage activities of RNA polymerase II in a stalled elongation complex. By site-directed mutagenesis, we have demonstrated that invariant residues Asp-261 and Glu-262 of the nucleic acid-binding TFIIS Zn ribbon are critical for stimulation of both elongation and RNA cleavage activities of RNA polymerase II. Substitution of either of these residues inactivates both TFIIS functions, suggesting a related role in both activities. These acidic residues may participate in phosphoryl transfer reactions by a two-metal-ion mechanism in a manner analogous to Klenow fragment. The RNA polymerase II itself may contain a Zn ribbon, in as much as the polymerase's 15-kDa subunit contains a sequence that aligns well with the TFIIS Zn ribbon sequence, including a similarly placed pair of acidic residues.",
    "The ubiquitination of rag A GTPase by RNF152 negatively regulates mTORC1 activation. mTORC1 is essential for regulating cell growth and metabolism in response to various environmental stimuli. Heterodimeric Rag GTPases are required for amino-acid-mediated mTORC1 activation at the lysosome. However, the mechanism by which amino acids regulate Rag activation remains not fully understood. Here, we identified the lysosome-anchored E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF152 as an essential negative regulator of the mTORC1 pathway by targeting RagA for K63-linked ubiquitination. RNF152 interacts with and ubiquitinates RagA in an amino-acid-sensitive manner. The mutation of RagA ubiquitination sites abolishes this effect of RNF152 and enhances the RagA-mediated activation of mTORC1. Ubiquitination by RNF152 generates an anchor on RagA to recruit its inhibitor GATOR1, a GAP complex for Rag GTPases. RNF152 knockout results in the hyperactivation of mTORC1 and protects cells from amino-acid-starvation-induced autophagy. Thus, this study reveals a mechanism for regulation of mTORC1 signaling by RNF152-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination of RagA.",
    "The use of cffDNA in fetal sex determination during the first trimester of pregnancy of female DMD carriers. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis for fetal sex determination is generally the first step in the prenatal diagnosis of X-linked genetic disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). However, non-invasive prenatal diagnostic (NIPD) techniques such as measurement of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma are preferable given the procedure-related miscarriage rate of CVS. We determined fetal sex during the first trimester using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay of cffDNA in pregnant carriers of DMD. The fetal sex was confirmed by amniocentesis karyotype analysis and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) at 16 weeks. This procedure may avoid unnecessary CVS or amniocentesis of female fetuses.",
    "The zinc cluster proteins Upc2 and Ecm22 promote filamentation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by sterol biosynthesis-dependent and -independent pathways. The transition between a unicellular yeast form to multicellular filaments is crucial for budding yeast foraging and the pathogenesis of many fungal pathogens such as Candida albicans. Here, we examine the role of the related transcription factors Ecm22 and Upc2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation. Overexpression of either ECM22 or UPC2 leads to increased filamentation, whereas cells lacking both ECM22 and UPC2 do not exhibit filamentous growth. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively control the expression of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. These genes all play a positive role in filamentous growth, and their expression is upregulated during filamentation in an Ecm22/Upc2-dependent manner. Furthermore, ergosterol content increases during filamentous growth. UPC2 expression also increases during filamentation and is inhibited by the transcription factors Sut1 and Sut2. The expression of SUT1 and SUT2 in turn is under negative control of the transcription factor Ste12. We suggest that during filamentation Ste12 becomes activated and reduces SUT1/SUT2 expression levels. This would result in increased UPC2 levels and as a consequence to transcriptional activation of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. Higher ergosterol levels in combination with the proteins Fhn1, Npr1 and Prr2 would then mediate the transition to filamentous growth.",
    "Therapeutic molecules and endogenous ligands regulate the interaction between brain cellular prion protein (PrPC) and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). Soluble Amyloid-\u03b2 oligomers (A\u03b2o) can trigger Alzheimer disease (AD) pathophysiology by binding to cell surface cellular prion protein (PrP(C)). PrP(C) interacts physically with metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), and this interaction controls the transmission of neurotoxic signals to intracellular substrates. Because the interruption of the signal transduction from PrP(C) to mGluR5 has therapeutic potential for AD, we developed assays to explore the effect of endogenous ligands, agonists/antagonists, and antibodies on the interaction between PrP(C) and mGluR5 in cell lines and mouse brain. We show that the PrP(C) segment of amino acids 91-153 mediates the interaction with mGluR5. Agonists of mGluR5 increase the mGluR5-PrP(C) interaction, whereas mGluR5 antagonists suppress protein association. Synthetic A\u03b2o promotes the protein interaction in mouse brain and transfected HEK-293 cell membrane preparations. The interaction of PrP(C) and mGluR5 is enhanced dramatically in the brains of familial AD transgenic model mice. In brain homogenates with A\u03b2o, the interaction of PrP(C) and mGluR5 is reversed by mGluR5-directed antagonists or antibodies directed against the PrP(C) segment of amino acids 91-153. Silent allosteric modulators of mGluR5 do not alter Glu or basal mGluR5 activity, but they disrupt the A\u03b2o-induced interaction of mGluR5 with PrP(C). The assays described here have the potential to identify and develop new compounds that inhibit the interaction of PrP(C) and mGluR5, which plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease by transmitting the signal from extracellular A\u03b2o into the cytosol.",
    "Three periods of regulatory innovation during vertebrate evolution. The gain, loss, and modification of gene regulatory elements may underlie a substantial proportion of phenotypic changes on animal lineages. To investigate the gain of regulatory elements throughout vertebrate evolution, we identified genome-wide sets of putative regulatory regions for five vertebrates, including humans. These putative regulatory regions are conserved nonexonic elements (CNEEs), which are evolutionarily conserved yet do not overlap any coding or noncoding mature transcript. We then inferred the branch on which each CNEE came under selective constraint. Our analysis identified three extended periods in the evolution of gene regulatory elements. Early vertebrate evolution was characterized by regulatory gains near transcription factors and developmental genes, but this trend was replaced by innovations near extracellular signaling genes, and then innovations near posttranslational protein modifiers.",
    "Thyroid hormone transporters and resistance. Cellular entry is an important step preceding intracellular metabolism and action of thyroid hormone (TH). Transport of TH across the plasma membrane does not take place by simple diffusion but requires transporter proteins. One of the most effective and specific TH transporters identified to date is monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), the gene of which is located on the X chromosome. Although MCT8 is expressed in many tissues, its function appears to be most critical in the brain. Hemizygous MCT8 mutations in males cause severe psychomotor retardation, known as the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS), and abnormal serum TH levels. AHDS thus represents a type of TH resistance caused by a defect in cellular TH transport.",
    "Thyroid hypoplasia as a cause of congenital hypothyroidism in Williams syndrome. In the Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), disorders of the thyroid function and morphology have been reported and programs of thyroid screening and surveillance are recommended. However, the frequency of biochemical thyroid assessment, particularly in the first year of life, is being debated. In this report we describe an infant with WBS and congenital hypothyroidism, due to an important thyroid hypoplasia. The patient, a 1-month-old female, negative at primary neonatal thyroid screening, was referred to our hospital for dyspnea. Thyroid function tests showed a raised TSH (42 mIU/l; normal range 0.5-4 mIU/l) with a low FT(4) concentration (10.21 pmol/l; normal range: 10.29-24.45 pmol/l). Ultrasound examination of the neck showed a significant thyroid hypoplasia, whereas (99m)Tc-pertechnetate thyroid scintigraphy evidenced a thyroid gland in normal position, with reduced shape and overall weak fixation. Therefore, treatment with L-thyroxinewas started. Thyroid hypoplasia is a frequent characteristic of WBS and abnormalities of thyroid function are common in patients with this feature. Therefore, the possibility of congenital hypothyroidism should always be taken into consideration too and, even if congenital hypothyroidism neonatal screening is negative, thyroid (morphology and function) evaluation should be regularly assessed when the diagnosis is made and, thereafter, every year in the first years of life.",
    "Tietz/Waardenburg type 2A syndrome associated with posterior microphthalmos in two unrelated patients with novel MITF gene mutations. Tietz syndrome and Waardenburg syndrome type 2A are allelic conditions caused by MITF mutations. Tietz syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and is characterized by congenital deafness and generalized skin, hair, and eye hypopigmentation, while Waardenburg syndrome type 2A typically includes variable degrees of sensorineural hearing loss and patches of de-pigmented skin, hair, and irides. In this paper, we report two unrelated families with MITF mutations. The first family showed an autosomal dominant pattern and variable expressivity. The second patient was isolated. MITF gene analysis in the first family demonstrated a c.648A>C heterozygous mutation in exon 8 c.648A>C; p. (R216S), while in the isolated patient, an apparently de novo heterozygous c.1183_1184insG truncating mutation was demonstrated in exon 10. All patients except one had bilateral reduced ocular anteroposterior axial length and a high hyperopic refractive error corresponding to posterior microphthalmos, features that have not been described as part of the disease. Our results suggest that posterior microphthalmos might be part of the clinical characteristics of Tietz/Waardenburg syndrome type 2A and expand both the clinical and molecular spectrum of the disease. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",
    "Tofacitinib: The First Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety, dosage administration, and adverse effects of tofacitinib for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment. DATA SOURCES: Primary sources of information were obtained from clinical studies, which were identified through PubMed (1966 to June 2013) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 to March 2013) using terms: tofacitinib, tasocitinib, CP-690550, and CP-690,550. Information was used from tofacitinib package insert, guidelines, and published abstracts from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Data search was limited to include publications in English language and from human subjects. DATA SYNTHESIS: Tofacitinib is the first oral Janus kinase inhibitor indicated for treatment of moderate to severe RA. Tofacitinib demonstrated efficacy and safety comparable to other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Tofacitinib was efficacious in RA patients, indicated by achievements of ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 criteria. Similar improvements were observed in patients who met remission criteria based on the Disease Activity Scores 28 criteria and quality of life as measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI). Tofacitinib was associated with infections and malignancies; and elevations in serum creatinine and lipids were observed. Drug interactions with inducers and inhibitors of the cytochrome P-450 3A4 and 2C9 isoenzymes were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Tofacitinib is an oral treatment option for RA patients who have inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate. Postmarket surveillance will provide further insight to tofacitinib's role in RA therapy, especially in patients who may require different types of combination therapy with DMARDS.",
    "Top-down protein identification using isotopic envelope fingerprinting. For top-down protein database search and identification from tandem mass spectra, our isotopic envelope fingerprinting search algorithm and ProteinGoggle search engine have demonstrated their strength of efficiently resolving heavily overlapping data as well separating non-ideal data with non-ideal isotopic envelopes from ideal ones with ideal isotopic envelopes. Here we report our updated ProteinGoggle 2.0 for intact protein database search with full-capacity. The indispensable updates include users' optional definition of dynamic post-translational modifications and static chemical labeling during database creation, comprehensive dissociation methods and ion series, as well as a Proteoform Score for each proteoform. ProteinGoggle has previously been benchmarked with both collision-based dissociation (CID, HCD) and electron-based dissociation (ETD) data of either intact proteins or intact proteomes. Here we report our further benchmarking of the new version of ProteinGoggle with publically available photon-based dissociation (UVPD) data (http://hdl.handle.net/2022/17316) of intact E. coli ribosomal proteins. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Protein species (aka proteoforms) function at their molecular level, and diverse structures and biological roles of every proteoform come from often co-occurring proteolysis, amino acid variation and post-translational modifications. Complete and high-throughput capture of this combinatorial information of proteoforms has become possible in evolving top-down proteomics; yet, various methods and technologies, especially database search and bioinformatics identification tools, in the top-down pipeline are still in their infancy stages and demand intensive research and development.",
    "Transcription elongation and tissue-specific somatic CAG instability. The expansion of CAG/CTG repeats is responsible for many diseases, including Huntington's disease (HD) and myotonic dystrophy 1. CAG/CTG expansions are unstable in selective somatic tissues, which accelerates disease progression. The mechanisms underlying repeat instability are complex, and it remains unclear whether chromatin structure and/or transcription contribute to somatic CAG/CTG instability in vivo. To address these issues, we investigated the relationship between CAG instability, chromatin structure, and transcription at the HD locus using the R6/1 and R6/2 HD transgenic mouse lines. These mice express a similar transgene, albeit integrated at a different site, and recapitulate HD tissue-specific instability. We show that instability rates are increased in R6/2 tissues as compared to R6/1 matched-samples. High transgene expression levels and chromatin accessibility correlated with the increased CAG instability of R6/2 mice. Transgene mRNA and H3K4 trimethylation at the HD locus were increased, whereas H3K9 dimethylation was reduced in R6/2 tissues relative to R6/1 matched-tissues. However, the levels of transgene expression and these specific histone marks were similar in the striatum and cerebellum, two tissues showing very different CAG instability levels, irrespective of mouse line. Interestingly, the levels of elongating RNA Pol II at the HD locus, but not the initiating form of RNA Pol II, were tissue-specific and correlated with CAG instability levels. Similarly, H3K36 trimethylation, a mark associated with transcription elongation, was specifically increased at the HD locus in the striatum and not in the cerebellum. Together, our data support the view that transcription modulates somatic CAG instability in vivo. More specifically, our results suggest for the first time that transcription elongation is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner, contributing to tissue-selective CAG instability.",
    "Transcription-associated mutation in Bacillus subtilis cells under stress. Adaptive (stationary phase) mutagenesis is a phenomenon by which nondividing cells acquire beneficial mutations as a response to stress. Although the generation of adaptive mutations is essentially stochastic, genetic factors are involved in this phenomenon. We examined how defects in a transcriptional factor, previously reported to alter the acquisition of adaptive mutations, affected mutation levels in a gene under selection. The acquisition of mutations was directly correlated to the level of transcription of a defective leuC allele placed under selection. To further examine the correlation between transcription and adaptive mutation, we placed a point-mutated allele, leuC427, under the control of an inducible promoter and assayed the level of reversion to leucine prototrophy under conditions of leucine starvation. Our results demonstrate that the level of Leu(+) reversions increased significantly in parallel with the induced increase in transcription levels. This mutagenic response was not observed under conditions of exponential growth. Since transcription is a ubiquitous biological process, transcription-associated mutagenesis may influence evolutionary processes in all organisms.",
    "Transcriptional regulator PRDM12 is essential for human pain perception. Pain perception has evolved as a warning mechanism to alert organisms to tissue damage and dangerous environments. In humans, however, undesirable, excessive or chronic pain is a common and major societal burden for which available medical treatments are currently suboptimal. New therapeutic options have recently been derived from studies of individuals with congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP). Here we identified 10 different homozygous mutations in PRDM12 (encoding PRDI-BF1 and RIZ homology domain-containing protein 12) in subjects with CIP from 11 families. Prdm proteins are a family of epigenetic regulators that control neural specification and neurogenesis. We determined that Prdm12 is expressed in nociceptors and their progenitors and participates in the development of sensory neurons in Xenopus embryos. Moreover, CIP-associated mutants abrogate the histone-modifying potential associated with wild-type Prdm12. Prdm12 emerges as a key factor in the orchestration of sensory neurogenesis and may hold promise as a target for new pain therapeutics.",
    "Transcriptome analysis identifies Bacillus anthracis genes that respond to CO2 through an AtxA-dependent mechanism. BACKGROUND: Upon infection of a mammalian host, Bacillus anthracis responds to host cues, and particularly to elevated temperature (37\u00b0C) and bicarbonate/CO2 concentrations, with increased expression of virulence factors that include the anthrax toxins and extracellular capsular layer. This response requires the presence of the pXO1 virulence plasmid-encoded pleiotropic regulator AtxA. To better understand the genetic basis of this response, we utilized a controlled in vitro system and Next Generation sequencing to determine and compare RNA expression profiles of the parental strain and an isogenic AtxA-deficient strain in a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial design with growth environments containing or lacking carbon dioxide. RESULTS: We found 15 pXO1-encoded genes and 3 chromosomal genes that were strongly regulated by the separate or synergistic actions of AtxA and carbon dioxide. The majority of the regulated genes responded to both AtxA and carbon dioxide rather than to just one of these factors. Interestingly, we identified two previously unrecognized small RNAs that are highly expressed under physiological carbon dioxide concentrations in an AtxA-dependent manner. Expression levels of the two small RNAs were found to be higher than that of any other gene differentially expressed in response to these conditions. Secondary structure and small RNA-mRNA binding predictions for the two small RNAs suggest that they may perform important functions in regulating B. anthracis virulence. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of genes on the virulence plasmid pXO1 that are regulated by the presence of either CO2 or AtxA separately are also regulated synergistically in the presence of both. These results also elucidate novel pXO1-encoded small RNAs that are associated with virulence conditions.",
    "Transducer of erbB2.1 is a potential cellular target of gefitinib in lung cancer therapy. Gefitinib, the specific inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), may cause growth delay in cancer cell lines. Thorough understanding of the downstream cellular signaling of gefitinib will facilitate the discovery of biomarkers for predicting outcomes and monitoring anti-EGFR therapies, and provide information for key targets for therapeutic intervention. In this study, we investigated the role of transducer of erbB2.1 (TOB1) in gefitinib therapy. Using the lung carcinoma cell lines A549 and NCI-H1975, the results suggested that gefitinib might mediate cell cycle arrest in lung cancer cells at least by targeting TOB1 expression. Gefitinib treatment caused cell cycle arrest predominantly at the G1 phase, which is associated with TOB1 nuclear translocation and its interaction with cyclin D1. We also showed that knockdown of TOB1 expression by RNAi rescued lung cancer cells from gefitinib-induced cell-proliferative arrest. These results suggest that TOB1 interaction with cyclin D1 and nuclear translocation is directly involved in the gefitinib-induced anti-proliferative cell cycle arrest.",
    "Transsphenoidal surgery for a life-threatening prolactinoma apoplexy during pregnancy. Prolactinoma is the most common secreting pituitary adenoma. It is typically diagnosed in women of reproductive age and is common cause of infertility. Currently the treatment of choice is pharmacotherapy with dopamine agonists, whereas surgical treatment is reserved for a selected group of patients. Pituitary-tumor apoplexy is a rare, life-threatening condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The authors present the case of a 25-year-old woman with prolactinoma treated with dopamine agonist. In course of such a treatment the patient became pregnant. The bromocriptine was gradually withdrawn. In the 14th week of pregnancy she was admitted for symptoms suggesting pituitary tumor apoplexy. The treatment with bromocriptine was reinitiated. In the 20th week of pregnancy further deterioration of the patient's neurological condition and visual-field abnormalities were observed. The patient was qualified for surgical treatment - selective transsphenoidal adenomectomy. The successful surgery led to improvement of neurological condition. The early postoperative PRL level decreased significantly and hormonal function of the pituitary was preserved. The pregnancy ended in 38th week with a caesarean section. Endocrinological evaluation conducted after the uneventful delivery confirmed normal function of the pituitary. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not reveal tumor re-growth. The patient is kept under constant medical care. In this case study the authors discussed therapeutic management and reviewed literature regarding gestational pituitary-tumor apoplexy with particular emphasis on surgical treatment.",
    "Treatment of Phthiriasis Palpebrarum and Crab Louse: Petrolatum Jelly and 1% Permethrin Shampoo. Phthiriasis palpebrarum is an uncommon cause of blepharoconjunctivitis in which Pthirus pubis infest the eyelashes. We report a case of unilateral phthiriasis palpebrarum with crab louse. A 45-year-old man presented with conjunctival hyperaemia and moderate itching associated with irritation, and crusty excretions of the eyelashes in the left eye. Careful slit-lamp examination revealed many lice and nits in left eye and mild conjunctival hyperaemia. No abnormality was found in the right eye. On dermatologic examination, only one louse was found at the pubic area. The patient was treated effectively with petrolatum jelly (Vaseline) and 1% permethrin shampoo (Kwellada 1% shampoo). At the end of the first week no louse or nit was present on eyelashes and pubic area.",
    "Trends in inulinase production--a review. This article highlights the research work carried out in the production of inulinases from various inulin substrates using strains of bacteria, yeast and fungi. Inulin is one of the numerous polysaccharides of plant origin that contains glucose or fructose. It is used as a substrate in industrial fermentation processes and in food industries due to its relatively cheap and abundant source for the microbiological production of high-fructose syrups, ethanol and acetone-butanol. The various oligosaccharides derived from inulin also find their application in the medical and dietary sector. The inulinase acts on the beta-(2,1)-D-fructoside links in inulin releasing D-fructose. Hence, this article illustrates the capability of various microbes in hydrolyzing the carbon at its optimum nutrient concentration and operating condition towards inulinase production.",
    "Trial design and rationale for APOLLO, a Phase 3, placebo-controlled study of patisiran in patients with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. BACKGROUND: Patisiran is an investigational RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic in development for the treatment of hereditary ATTR (hATTR) amyloidosis, a progressive disease associated with significant disability, morbidity, and mortality. METHODS: Here we describe the rationale and design of the Phase 3 APOLLO study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of patisiran in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. Eligible patients are 18-85\u00a0years old with hATTR amyloidosis, investigator-estimated survival of > 2\u00a0years, Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) of 5-130, and polyneuropathy disability score\u00a0 < IIIb. Patients are randomized 2:1 to receive either intravenous patisiran 0.3\u00a0mg/kg or placebo once every 3\u00a0weeks. The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of patisiran at 18\u00a0months based on the difference in the change in modified NIS+7 (a composite measure of motor strength, sensation, reflexes, nerve conduction, and autonomic function) between the patisiran and placebo groups. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of patisiran on Norfolk-Diabetic Neuropathy quality of life questionnaire score, nutritional status (as evaluated by modified body mass index), motor function (as measured by NIS-weakness and timed 10-m walk test), and autonomic symptoms (as measured by the Composite Autonomic Symptom Score-31 questionnaire). Exploratory objectives include assessment of cardiac function and pathologic evaluation to assess nerve fiber innervation and amyloid burden. Safety of patisiran will be assessed throughout the study. DISCUSSION: APOLLO represents the largest randomized, Phase 3 study to date in patients with hATTR amyloidosis, with endpoints that capture the multisystemic nature of this disease. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT01960348 ); October 9, 2013.",
    "Tripolin A, a novel small-molecule inhibitor of aurora A kinase, reveals new regulation of HURP's distribution on microtubules. Mitotic regulators exhibiting gain of function in tumor cells are considered useful cancer therapeutic targets for the development of small-molecule inhibitors. The human Aurora kinases are a family of such targets. In this study, from a panel of 105 potential small-molecule inhibitors, two compounds Tripolin A and Tripolin B, inhibited Aurora A kinase activity in vitro. In human cells however, only Tripolin A acted as an Aurora A inhibitor. We combined in vitro, in vivo single cell and in silico studies to demonstrate the biological action of Tripolin A, a non-ATP competitive inhibitor. Tripolin A reduced the localization of pAurora A on spindle microtubules (MTs), affected centrosome integrity, spindle formation and length, as well as MT dynamics in interphase, consistent with Aurora A inhibition by RNAi or other specific inhibitors, such as MLN8054 or MLN8237. Interestingly, Tripolin A affected the gradient distribution towards the chromosomes, but not the MT binding of HURP (Hepatoma Up-Regulated Protein), a MT-associated protein (MAP) and substrate of the Aurora A kinase. Therefore Tripolin A reveals a new way of regulating mitotic MT stabilizers through Aurora A phosphorylation. Tripolin A is predicted to bind Aurora A similarly but not identical to MLN8054, therefore it could be used to dissect pathways orchestrated by Aurora kinases as well as a scaffold for further inhibitor development.",
    "Two novel CHS1 (LYST) mutations: clinical correlations in an infant with Chediak-Higashi syndrome. Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by variable degrees of oculocutaneous albinism, recurrent infections, and a mild bleeding tendency, with late neurologic dysfunction. Most patients also undergo an accelerated phase of lymphohistiocytosis and die at an early age unless they receive an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (SCT). Mutations in the CHS1 (LYST) gene result in CHS. Here, we describe an adopted infant who is compound heterozygous for two novel CHS1 gene mutations, both of which are predicted to result in truncated proteins. The two mutations are a nonsense mutation (c.1540 C>T, CGA>TGA, R514X) in exon 5 and a one base pair deletion (del c.9893T, F3298fsX3304) in exon 43, coding for part of the CHS1 protein's BEACH domain. These two newly described mutations are expected to give rise to a severe phenotype and, indeed, the patient had absolutely no cytotoxicity by natural killer cells or cytotoxic lymphocytes prior to his allogeneic SCT.",
    "Type I interferon in organ-targeted autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. A significant role for IFN\u03b1 in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus is well supported, and clinical trials of anti-IFN\u03b1 monoclonal antibodies are in progress in this disease. In other autoimmune diseases characterized by substantial inflammation and tissue destruction, the role of type I interferons is less clear. Gene expression analysis of peripheral blood cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis demonstrate an interferon signature similar to but less intense than that seen in patients with lupus. In both of those diseases, presence of the interferon signature has been associated with more significant clinical manifestations. At the same time, evidence supports an anti-inflammatory and beneficial role of IFN\u03b2 locally in the joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and in murine arthritis models, and many patients with multiple sclerosis show a clinical response to recombinant IFN\u03b2. As can also be proposed for type I diabetes mellitus, type I interferon appears to contribute to the development of autoimmunity and disease progression in multiple autoimmune diseases, while maintaining some capacity to control established disease - particularly at local sites of inflammation. Recent studies in both rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis suggest that quantification of type I interferon activity or target gene expression might be informative in predicting responses to distinct classes of therapeutic agents.",
    "Ubiquilins in the crosstalk among proteolytic pathways. Protein degradation occurs through several distinct proteolytic pathways for membrane and cytosolic proteins. There is evidence that these processes are linked and that crosstalk among these major protein degradation pathways occurs. Ubiquilins, a family of ubiquitin-binding proteins, are involved in all protein degradation pathways. This minireview provides an overview of ubiquilin function in protein degradation and contrasts it with sequestosome-1 (p62), a protein that also has been implicated in multiple proteolytic pathways.",
    "Universal, class-specific and drug-specific reversal agents for the new oral anticoagulants. Although there is controversy about the absolute need for a reversal agent for the new direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), the absence of such an agent is a barrier to more widespread use of these agents. For the management of major life-threatening bleeding with the DOACs, most authorities recommend the use of four factor prothrombin complex concentrates, although the evidence to support their use in terms of improving outcomes is meager. At the present time, there are three antidotes in development and poised to enter the market. Idarucizumab is a drug-specific antidote targeted to reverse the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran. Andexanet alfa is a class-specific antidote targeted to reverse the oral direct factor Xa inhibitors as well as the indirect inhibitor, enoxaparin. Ciraparantag is a universal antidote targeted to reverse the direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors as well as the indirect inhibitor, enoxaparin.",

    "Update of the FANTOM web resource: from mammalian transcriptional landscape to its dynamic regulation. The international Functional Annotation Of the Mammalian Genomes 4 (FANTOM4) research collaboration set out to better understand the transcriptional network that regulates macrophage differentiation and to uncover novel components of the transcriptome employing a series of high-throughput experiments. The primary and unique technique is cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE), sequencing mRNA 5'-ends with a second-generation sequencer to quantify promoter activities even in the absence of gene annotation. Additional genome-wide experiments complement the setup including short RNA sequencing, microarray gene expression profiling on large-scale perturbation experiments and ChIP-chip for epigenetic marks and transcription factors. All the experiments are performed in a differentiation time course of the THP-1 human leukemic cell line. Furthermore, we performed a large-scale mammalian two-hybrid (M2H) assay between transcription factors and monitored their expression profile across human and mouse tissues with qRT-PCR to address combinatorial effects of regulation by transcription factors. These interdependent data have been analyzed individually and in combination with each other and are published in related but distinct papers. We provide all data together with systematic annotation in an integrated view as resource for the scientific community (http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/4/). Additionally, we assembled a rich set of derived analysis results including published predicted and validated regulatory interactions. Here we introduce the resource and its update after the initial release.",
    "Upregulated MALAT-1 contributes to bladder cancer cell migration by inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Recent studies reveal that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to have important regulatory roles in cancer biology, and lncRNA MALAT-1 expression is upregulated in some tumors. However, the contributions of MALAT-1 to bladder cancer metastasis remain largely unknown. In the present study we evaluated MALAT-1 expression in bladder cancer tissues by real-time PCR, and defined its biological functions. We verified that MALAT-1 levels were upregulated in bladder cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and MALAT-1 expression was remarkably increased in primary tumors that subsequently metastasized, when compared to those primary tumors that did not metastasize. SiRNA-mediated MALAT-1 silencing impaired in vitro bladder cancer cell migration. Downregulation of MALAT-1 resulted in a decrease of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated ZEB1, ZEB2 and Slug levels, and an increase of E-cadherin levels. We further demonstrated that MALAT-1 promoted EMT by activating Wnt signaling in vitro. These data suggest an important role for MALAT-1 in regulating metastasis of bladder cancer and the potential application of MALAT-1 in bladder cancer therapy.",
    "Upregulation of uc.189 in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and its clinicopathologic value. Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) encoding noncoding RNAs serve as important regulators in cancer biology. Until now, the role of the UCE uc.189 in human cancers remains undefined and the clinical significance of uc.189 in esophageal cancers remains unknown. This study was to identify the prognostic value of uc.189 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression level of uc.189 in matched cancerous tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues from 152 patients with ESCC. The correlation of uc.189 with clinicopathological features and prognosis were also analyzed. The expression of uc.189 was significantly higher in human ESCC compared with the adjacent noncancerous tissues (122/152, 80.3%, p<0.01), and the high level of uc.189 expression was significantly correlated with invasion of the tumor (p=0.009), advanced clinical stage (p=0.000), lymph node metastasis (p=0.000), and poor prognosis. High expression of uc.189 might reflect poor prognosis of ESCC and indicate a potential diagnostic target in ESCC patients. Uc.189 might be considered as a novel molecule involved in ESCC progression, which provides a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target.",
    "Using MRSA Screening Tests To Predict Methicillin Resistance in Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia. Bloodstream infections with Staphylococcus aureus are clinically significant and are often treated with empirical methicillin resistance (MRSA, methicillin-resistant S. aureus) coverage. However, vancomycin has associated harms. We hypothesized that MRSA screening correlated with resistance in S. aureus bacteremia and could help determine the requirement for empirical vancomycin therapy. We reviewed consecutive S. aureus bacteremias over a 5-year period at two tertiary care hospitals. MRSA colonization was evaluated in three ways: as tested within 30 days of bacteremia (30-day criterion), as tested within 30 days but accounting for any prior positive results (ever-positive criterion), or as tested in known-positive patients, with patients with unknown MRSA status being labeled negative (known-positive criterion). There were 409 S. aureus bacteremias: 302 (73.8%) methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and 107 (26.2%) MRSA bacteremias. In the 167 patients with MSSA bacteremias, 7.2% had a positive MRSA test within 30 days. Of 107 patients with MRSA bacteremia, 68 were tested within 30 days (54 positive; 79.8%), and another 21 (19.6%) were previously positive. The 30-day criterion provided negative predictive values (NPV) exceeding 90% and 95% if the prevalence of MRSA in S. aureus bacteremia was less than 33.4% and 19.2%, respectively. The same NPVs were predicted at MRSA proportions below 39.7% and 23.8%, respectively, for the ever-positive criterion and 34.4% and 19.9%, respectively, for the known-positive criterion. In MRSA-colonized patients, positive predictive values exceeded 50% at low prevalence. MRSA screening could help avoid empirical vancomycin therapy and its complications in stable patients and settings with low-to-moderate proportions of MRSA bacteremia.",
    "Using Mahalanobis distance to compare genomic signatures between bacterial plasmids and chromosomes. Plasmids are ubiquitous mobile elements that serve as a pool of many host beneficial traits such as antibiotic resistance in bacterial communities. To understand the importance of plasmids in horizontal gene transfer, we need to gain insight into the 'evolutionary history' of these plasmids, i.e. the range of hosts in which they have evolved. Since extensive data support the proposal that foreign DNA acquires the host's nucleotide composition during long-term residence, comparison of nucleotide composition of plasmids and chromosomes could shed light on a plasmid's evolutionary history. The average absolute dinucleotide relative abundance difference, termed delta-distance, has been commonly used to measure differences in dinucleotide composition, or 'genomic signature', between bacterial chromosomes and plasmids. Here, we introduce the Mahalanobis distance, which takes into account the variance-covariance structure of the chromosome signatures. We demonstrate that the Mahalanobis distance is better than the delta-distance at measuring genomic signature differences between plasmids and chromosomes of potential hosts. We illustrate the usefulness of this metric for proposing candidate long-term hosts for plasmids, focusing on the virulence plasmids pXO1 from Bacillus anthracis, and pO157 from Escherichia coli O157:H7, as well as the broad host range multi-drug resistance plasmid pB10 from an unknown host.",
    "VX-509 (decernotinib) is a potent and selective janus kinase 3 inhibitor that attenuates inflammation in animal models of autoimmune disease. Cytokines, growth factors, and other chemical messengers rely on a class of intracellular nonreceptor tyrosine kinases known as Janus kinases (JAKs) to rapidly transduce intracellular signals. A number of these cytokines are critical for lymphocyte development and mediating immune responses. JAK3 is of particular interest due to its importance in immune function and its expression, which is largely confined to lymphocytes, thus limiting the potential impact of JAK3 inhibition on nonimmune physiology. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potency and selectivity of the investigational JAK3 inhibitor VX-509 (decernotinib) [(R)-2-((2-(1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-3-yl)pyrimidin-4-yl)amino)-2-methyl-N-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)butanamide] against JAK3 kinase activity and inhibition of JAK3-mediated signaling in vitro and JAK3-dependent physiologic processes in vivo. These results demonstrate that VX-509 potently inhibits JAK3 in enzyme assays (Ki = 2.5 nM + 0.7 nM) and cellular assays dependent on JAK3 activity (IC50 range, 50-170 nM), with limited or no measurable potency against other JAK isotypes or non-JAK kinases. VX-509 also showed activity in two animal models of aberrant immune function. VX-509 treatment resulted in dose-dependent reduction in ankle swelling and paw weight and improved paw histopathology scores in the rat collagen-induced arthritis model. In a mouse model of oxazolone-induced delayed-type hypersensitivity, VX-509 reduced the T cell-mediated inflammatory response in skin. These findings demonstrate that VX-509 is a selective and potent inhibitor of JAK3 in vitro and modulates proinflammatory response in models of immune-mediated diseases, such as collagen-induced arthritis and delayed-type hypersensitivity. The data support evaluation of VX-509 for treatment of patients with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.",
    "Valbenazine granted breakthrough drug status for treating tardive dyskinesia. The chronic use and high dosing of typical neuroleptics or centrally acting dopamine receptor blocking antiemetics predispose patients to the onset of tardive syndromes. One particular subtype, tardive dyskinesia, is characterized by rapid, repetitive, stereotypic, involuntary movements of the face, limbs or trunk. The inhibition of the vesicular monoamine transporter system, using tetrabenazine therapy, improves the severity of tardive dyskinesia. But there are also drawbacks to tetrabenazine treatment, such as a fluctuating response and the need for frequent intake due to its rapid metabolism. Clinical research on the potentially more efficacious and easier to use tetrabenazine analogs is already under way. One of them is valbenazine, the purified parent drug of the (+)-\u03b1-isomer of tetrabenazine. The FDA lowered approval hurdles for valbenazine due to a successful Phase II trial, which showed a distinctive improvement in tardive dyskinesia symptoms during valbenazine administration. This resurgence in the clinical research of tardive syndrome therapy is most welcome. This author notes that the putative long-term side effects of valbenazine should carefully be investigated in the future via naturalistic observational trials. Furthermore, valbenazine may also support the onset of symptoms, such as Parkinsonism and depression, with chronic administration, as it, to a certain extent, shares the mode of action of tetrabenazine.",
    "Validation of the use of the ROSIER scale in prehospital assessment of stroke. AIM: To determine the utility of the Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale as a stroke recognition tool among Chinese patients in the prehospital setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Compared with the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS), emergency physicians prospectively used the ROSIER as a stroke recognition tool on suspected patients in the prehospital setting. And, the final discharge diagnosis of stroke or transient ischemic attack made by neurologists, after assessment and review of clinical symptomatology and brain imaging findings, was used as the reference standard for diagnosis in the study. Then, the ROSIER and the CPSS like sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), related coefficient (r) and Kappa value were calculated. RESULTS: In this study, 540 of 582 suspected stroke patients met the study criteria. The CPSS showed a diagnostic Se of 88.77% (95% confidence intervals [CI] 86.11-91.43%), Sp of 68.79% (95% CI 64.88-72.70%), PPV of 87.40% (95% CI 85.97-88.83%), NPV of 71.52% (95% CI 67.71-75.33%) and r of 0.503. Relatively, the ROSIER showed a diagnostic Se of 89.97% (95% CI 87.44-92.64%), Sp of 83.23% (95% CI 80.08-86.38%), PPV of 92.66% (95% CI 90.46-94.86%), NPV of 77.91% (95% CI 74.41-81.41%) and r of 0.584. According to the final discharge diagnosis, both the ROSIER and the CPSS were associated with the final discharge diagnosis (P < 0.05).The Kappa statistic value of the ROSIER and the CPSS were 0.718 and 0.582, respectively. However, there was no statistical significance of the positive rate between the ROSIER and the CPSS in this study (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The ROSIER is a sensitive and specific stroke recognition tool for health providers' use among Chinese patients in the prehospital setting. However, it cannot be used to confidently rule out or identify stroke as a diagnosis. Comprehensive clinical assessment and further examination on potential stroke patients are still important and cannot be replaced. When it is difficult to objectively complete the ROSIER for patients, the CPSS could replace it in the prehospital setting.",
    "Valsalva leak point pressure-associated Q-tip angle and simple female stress urinary incontinence symptoms. PURPOSE: To clarify the association between clinically defined simple stress urinary incontinence (SUI) symptoms and urodynamic SUI, we examined the relationship between Valsalva leak point pressure (VLPP) as measured by the Q-tip test and Stamey grade in simple female SUI. METHODS: Two hundred grade I or II female SUI patients with SUI symptom were examined by reviewing medical history; physical examination; urethral mobility as assessed by Q-tip test; stress test; and cystometry, including VLPP measurement. On the basis of the VLPP, patients were classified into urethral hypermobility [UH, subdivided into anatomical incontinence (AI) and equivocal incontinence (EI)] or intrinsic sphincter deficiency groups for analysis of the relationship between VLPP and Stamey grade and Q-tip angle. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients were included, and the mean patient age was 54 \u00b1 7.5 years, mean SUI symptom duration 2.8 years (range 0.5-6 years), mean VLPP 103.6 \u00b1 18.4 cm H2O, and mean Q-tip angle 28.6\u00b0 \u00b1 7.2\u00b0. Fifty-three patients were categorized as Stamey grade I, 25 as Stamey grade II, 51 as AI, and 27 as EI. VLPP was found to be negatively correlated with Q-tip angle (Rs = -0.798, Y = -0.313X + 60.95, P < 0.001), and classifications of VLPP and Stamey grade have positive correlation (\u03c7 (2) = 4.9130, P = 0.0267). CONCLUSIONS: In simple female SUI, VLPP is associated with the Q-tip angle and Stamey grade, which may help to reduce some of urodynamic items.",
    "Virus-associated small satellite RNAs and viroids display similarities in their replication strategies. Since the discovery of non-coding, small, highly structured, satellite RNAs (satRNAs) and viroids as subviral pathogens of plants , have been of great interest to molecular biologists as possible living fossils of pre-cellular evolution in an RNA world. Despite extensive studies performed in the last four decades, there is still mystery surrounding the origin and evolutionary relationship between these subviral pathogens. Recent technical advances revealed some commonly shared replication features between these two subviral pathogens. In this review, we discuss our current perception of replication and evolutionary origin of these petite RNA pathogens.",
    "Visualization of genomic data with the Hilbert curve. UNLABELLED: In many genomic studies, one works with genome-position-dependent data, e.g. ChIP-chip or ChIP-Seq scores. Using conventional tools, it can be difficult to get a good feel for the data, especially the distribution of features. This article argues that the so-called Hilbert curve visualization can complement genome browsers and help to get further insights into the structure of one's data. This is demonstrated with examples from different use cases. An open-source application, called HilbertVis, is presented that allows the user to produce and interactively explore such plots.

    "What determines the periportal free air, and ligamentum teres and falciform ligament signs on CT: can these specific air distributions be valuable predictors of gastroduodenal perforation? PURPOSE: The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine what gives rise to the periportal free air, and ligamentum teres and falciform ligament signs on CT in patients with gastrointestinal (GI) tract perforation, and whether these specific air distributions can play a clinically meaningful role in the diagnosis of gastroduodenal perforation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety-three patients who underwent a diagnostic CT scan before laparotomy for a GI tract perforation were included. The readers assessed the presence of specific air distributions on CT (periportal free air, and ligamentum teres and falciform ligament signs). The readers also assessed the presence of strong predictors of gastroduodenal perforation (focal defects in the stomach and duodenal bulb wall, concentrated extraluminal air bubbles in close proximity to the stomach and duodenal bulb, and wall thickening at the stomach and duodenal bulb). The specific air distributions were assessed according to perforation sites, and the elapsed time and amount of free air, and then compared with the strong predictors of gastroduodenal perforation by using statistical analysis. RESULTS: All specific air distributions were more frequently present in patients with gastroduodenal perforation than lower GI tract perforation, but only the falciform ligament sign was statistically significant (p<0.05). The presence of all three specific air distributions was demonstrated in only 13 (20.6%) of 63 patients with gastroduodenal perforation. Regardless of the perforation sites, the falciform ligament sign was present significantly more frequently with an increase in the amount of free air on multiple logistic regression analysis (adjusted odds ratio, 1.29; p<0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive predictive and negative predictive values of each strong predictor for the diagnosis of gastroduodenal perforation were higher than those of specific air distributions. The focal wall thickening (accuracy, 95.7%) was the most useful parameter for the diagnosis of gastroduodenal perforation. CONCLUSION: The prediction of the perforation site of the GI tract on CT should be based on the presence of strong predictors of the site of bowel perforation, and the specific free air distribution should be regarded as complementary predictors.",
    "When hepatoma rupture happens in situs inversus totalis: side matters. The authors reported a 73-year-old alcoholic man with previously-unrecognized situs inversus totalis suffering from left upper quadrant pain. Acute myocardial infarction was diagnosed and coronary angioplasty was performed immediately. However, the massive bleeding from the previously-unfound hepatomas caused hypovolemic shock and fatal outcome. Situs inversus totalis is a rare congenital anomaly with a complete mirror image of the thoracic and abdominal organs. Although being considered a benign entity, it would disturb diagnosis-making of the visceral diseases owing to the altered anatomy. To our knowledge, the coexistence of the coronary artery disease and ruptured hepatomas in situs inversus totalis, as in our patient, is never described. Recognition of any situs anomalies in time is the key to avoid misdiagnosis, inappropriate managements, and unwanted consequences.",
    "White matter damage is related to ataxia severity in SCA3. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is the most frequent inherited cerebellar ataxia in Europe, the US and Japan, leading to disability and death through motor complications. Although the affected protein ataxin-3 is found ubiquitously in the brain, grey matter atrophy is predominant in the cerebellum and the brainstem. White matter pathology is generally less severe and thought to occur in the brainstem, spinal cord, and cerebellar white matter. Here, we investigated both grey and white matter pathology in a group of 12 SCA3 patients and matched controls. We used voxel-based morphometry for analysis of tissue loss, and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) on diffusion magnetic resonance imaging to investigate microstructural pathology. We analysed correlations between microstructural properties of the brain and ataxia severity, as measured by the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) score. SCA3 patients exhibited significant loss of both grey and white matter in the cerebellar hemispheres, brainstem including pons and in lateral thalamus. On between-group analysis, TBSS detected widespread microstructural white matter pathology in the cerebellum, brainstem, and bilaterally in thalamus and the cerebral hemispheres. Furthermore, fractional anisotropy in a white matter network comprising frontal, thalamic, brainstem and left cerebellar white matter strongly and negatively correlated with SARA ataxia scores. Tractography identified the thalamic white matter thus implicated as belonging to ventrolateral thalamus. Disruption of white matter integrity in patients suffering from SCA3 is more widespread than previously thought. Moreover, our data provide evidence that microstructural white matter changes in SCA3 are strongly related to the clinical severity of ataxia symptoms.",
    "Wilson's disease: an update. Wilson's disease (WD) is an inborn error of copper metabolism caused by a mutation to the copper-transporting gene ATP7B. The disease has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, and is characterized by excessive copper deposition, predominantly in the liver and brain. Diagnosis of the condition depends primarily on clinical features, biochemical parameters and the presence of the Kayser-Fleischer ring, and a new diagnostic scoring system has recently been proposed. Mutations in ATP7B can occur anywhere along the entire 21 exons, which makes the identification of gene defects particularly challenging. Identification of carriers and presymptomatic family members of affected individuals is achieved by polymerase-chain-reaction-based marker analysis. The traditional treatment for WD is based on copper chelation with agents such as D-penicillamine, but use of this drug has been questioned because of reported side effects. The use of agents such as trientine and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate has been advocated, although results of long-term trials are awaited. In selected cases, orthotropic hepatic transplantation can reverse the basic metabolic abnormality in WD and improve both hepatic and neurological symptoms. Studies of the underlying defects in ATP7B and its suspected modifiers ATOX1 and COMMD1 are expected to unravel the disease's genotype-phenotype correlation, and should lead to the design of improved drugs for ameliorating the suffering of patients.",
    "Woman with x-linked recessive dystonia-parkinsonism: clue to the epidemiology of parkinsonism in Filipino women? IMPORTANCE: Despite recessive inheritance, X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (Lubag disease) has also been described in women presenting with a late-onset isolated parkinsonian syndrome. Interestingly, unlike in other populations, there is a slight female predominance in the prevalence of parkinsonism in the Philippines. OBSERVATIONS: In a Filipino woman with suspected Parkinson disease, we confirmed the presence of all changes specific for X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism in genomic DNA. Subsequently, we analyzed complementary DNA and evaluated the methylation status of the androgen receptor gene. Owing to extremely skewed (98%:2%) X-chromosome inactivation, the patient expressed almost solely the mutated allele in a disease-specific change, rendering her molecularly comparable with a hemizygously affected man. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Skewed X-chromosome inactivation is the likely cause of parkinsonism in this heterozygous mutation carrier. Because women carriers of the genetic changes specific for X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism are common in the Philippines, the epigenetic factor of nonrandom X-chromosome inactivation may contribute to the skewing of the sex prevalence of parkinsonism toward women in this country, warranting further investigation.",
    "X-linked Christianson syndrome: heterozygous female Slc9a6 knockout mice develop mosaic neuropathological changes and related behavioral abnormalities. Christianson syndrome (CS) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental and neurological disorder characterized in males by core symptoms that include non-verbal status, intellectual disability, epilepsy, truncal ataxia, postnatal microcephaly and hyperkinesis. CS is caused by mutations in the SLC9A6 gene, which encodes a multipass transmembrane sodium (potassium)-hydrogen exchanger 6 (NHE6) protein, functional in early recycling endosomes. The extent and variability of the CS phenotype in female heterozygotes, who presumably express the wild-type and mutant SLC9A6 alleles mosaically as a result of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), have not yet been systematically characterized. Slc9a6 knockout mice (Slc9a6 KO) were generated by insertion of the bacterial lacZ/\u03b2-galactosidase (\u03b2-Gal) reporter into exon 6 of the X-linked gene. Mutant Slc9a6 KO male mice have been shown to develop late endosomal/lysosomal dysfunction associated with glycolipid accumulation in selected neuronal populations and patterned degeneration of Purkinje cells (PCs). In heterozygous female Slc9a6 KO mice, \u03b2-Gal serves as a transcriptional/XCI reporter and thus facilitates testing of effects of mosaic expression of the mutant allele on penetrance of the abnormal phenotype. Using \u03b2-Gal, we demonstrated mosaic expression of the mutant Slc9a6 allele and mosaically distributed lysosomal glycolipid accumulation and PC pathology in the brains of heterozygous Slc9a6 KO female mice. At the behavioral level, we showed that heterozygous female mice suffer from visuospatial memory and motor coordination deficits similar to but less severe than those observed in X-chromosome hemizygous mutant males. Our studies in heterozygous Slc9a6 KO female mice provide important clues for understanding the likely phenotypic range of Christianson syndrome among females heterozygous for SLC9A6 mutations and might improve diagnostic practice and genetic counseling by helping to characterize this presumably underappreciated patient/carrier group.",
    "Yeast DNA topoisomerase II is encoded by a single-copy, essential gene. The gene TOP2 encoding yeast topoisomerase II has been cloned by immunological screening of a yeast genomic library constructed in the phage lambda expression vector, lambda gt11. The ends of the message encoded by the cloned DNA fragment were delimited by the Berk and Sharp procedure (S1 nuclease mapping) for the 5' end and mapping of the polyA tail portion of a cDNA fragment for the 3' end. The predicted size of the message agrees with the length of the message as determined by Northern blot hybridization analysis. The identity of the gene was confirmed by expressing the gene in E. coli from the E. coli promoter lac UV5 to give catalytically active yeast DNA topoisomerase II. Disruption of one copy of the gene in a diploid yeast creates a recessive lethal mutation, indicating that the single DNA topoisomerase II gene of yeast has an essential function.",
    "Zika virus emergence in mosquitoes in southeastern Senegal, 2011. BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV; genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae) is maintained in a zoonotic cycle between arboreal Aedes spp. mosquitoes and nonhuman primates in African and Asian forests. Spillover into humans has been documented in both regions and the virus is currently responsible for a large outbreak in French Polynesia. ZIKV amplifications are frequent in southeastern Senegal but little is known about their seasonal and spatial dynamics. The aim of this paper is to describe the spatio-temporal patterns of the 2011 ZIKV amplification in southeastern Senegal. METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: Mosquitoes were collected monthly from April to December 2011 except during July. Each evening from 18:00 to 21:00 hrs landing collections were performed by teams of 3 persons working simultaneously in forest (canopy and ground), savannah, agriculture, village (indoor and outdoor) and barren land cover sites. Mosquitoes were tested for virus infection by virus isolation and RT-PCR. ZIKV was detected in 31 of the 1,700 mosquito pools (11,247 mosquitoes) tested: Ae. furcifer (5), Ae. luteocephalus (5), Ae. africanus (5), Ae. vittatus (3), Ae. taylori, Ae. dalzieli, Ae. hirsutus and Ae. metallicus (2 each) and Ae. aegypti, Ae. unilinaetus, Ma. uniformis, Cx. perfuscus and An. coustani (1 pool each) collected in June (3), September (10), October (11), November (6) and December (1). ZIKV was detected from mosquitoes collected in all land cover classes except indoor locations within villages. The virus was detected in only one of the ten villages investigated. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This ZIKV amplification was widespread in the K\u00e9dougou area, involved several mosquito species as probable vectors, and encompassed all investigated land cover classes except indoor locations within villages. Aedes furcifer males and Aedes vittatus were found infected within a village, thus these species are probably involved in the transmission of Zika virus to humans in this environment.",
    "[An overview of oculocutaneous albinism: TYR gene mutations in five Colombian individuals]. INTRODUCTION: Oculocutaneus albinism is a pigment-related inherited disorder characterized by hypopigmentation of the skin, hair and eyes, foveal hypoplasia and low vision. To date, 230 mutations in the TYR gene have been reported as responsible for oculocutaneus albinism type 1 worldwide. TYR gene encodes the enzyme tyrosinase involved in the metabolic pathway of melanin synthesis. OBJECTIVES: Mutations were identified in the TYR gene as responsible for oculocutaneous albinism type 1 in five Colombian individuals, and a new ophthalmic system was tested that corrected visual defects and symptoms in a patient with oculocutaneous albinism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples were taken from 5 individuals, four of whom belong to a single family, along with a fifth individual not related to the family. Five exons in the TYR gene were sequenced to search for the gene carriers in the family and in the non-related individual. In addition, clinical ophthalmological evaluation and implementation of an new oculo-visual system was undertaken. RESULTS: A G47D and 1379delTT mutation was identified in the family. The unrelated individual carried a compound heterozygote for the G47D and D42N mutations. The oculo-visual corrective system was able to increase visual acuity and to diminish the nystagmus and photophobia. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study in Colombia where albinism mutations are reported. The methods developed will enable future molecular screening studies in Colombian populations.",

    "[Gaucher's disease uncovered late]. Gaucher's disease is an uncommon inborn recessive autosomal disease, due to a deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme beta glucocerebrosidase. This disease is usually diagnosed in the first or second decade of life with the arising of bone pains, splenomegaly and hemorragic manifestations due to thrombocytopenia. When the enlarged spleen is not evident, or after splenectomy, patients may be mis-identified as having Gaucher's disease. We present here two cases of elderly patients aged 70 and 46 years respectively, in whom the disease was a surprising finding of bone marrow examination, during check up for pancytopenia.",
    "[Influence of ketogenic diet on the clinical effects and electroencephalogram features in 31 children with pharmacoresistant epileptic encephalopathy]. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of ketogenic diet (KD) on the clinical and electroencephalogram features in children with pharmacoresistant epileptic encephalopathy. METHOD: Thirty-one children (19 boys, 12 girls) aged 7 months to 7 years (mean 2 years 5 month) with epilepsy refractory to conventional antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were included in this study. In addition to their original AED treatment, the children were assigned to different ketogenic diets based on their age. The prospective electro-clinical assessment was performed prior to the KD and then one week, one month and again 3 months after the initiation of therapy, respectively. RESULT: The reduction of seizure frequency in 52%, 68% and 71% of all patients exceeded 50% one week, one month and three months after KD treatment respectively. KD is particularly effective in myoclonic astatic epilepsy (MAE; Doose Syndrome) and West syndrome with 100% and 81.25% of the patients having a greater than 50% seizure reduction, respectively. After 3 months of KD treatment, more than 2/3 patients experienced a reduction in interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) and improvement in EEG background. CONCLUSION: The clinical and electroencephalographic improvement confirms that KD is beneficial in children with refractory epilepsy.",

This is a report about a 9 year old turkish boy suffering from recurrent episodes of high fever caused by Plasmodium vivax-infection (Malaria tertiana), 12 months after returning from his malarious homeland. After a 3-day course of Chloroquin, we administrated Primaquin to eliminate residual extraerythrocyte forms of Plasmodium vivax. On the 7th day of treatment acute haemolysis developped. This was caused by Glucose-6-Phosphate-Dehydrogenase-Deficiency, which could be demonstrated by a red-cell-enzyme analysis.

    "[Paraneoplastic hypoglycemia: The hopes of pathophysiological documentation]. Doege-Potter syndrome\u00a0is a paraneoplastic\u00a0syndrome\u00a0characterized by non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia secondary to a solitary fibrous tumor. These tumors are rare and usually asymptomatic. The syndrome of hypoglycemia is seen in less than 5% of the cases, and the associated tumors are large with a high mitotic rate. The cause of hypoglycemia is related to insulin-like growth factors produced by these tumors called \"big\" IGF-2. Several biological tests can demonstrate the increase of \"big\" IGF-2\u00a0plasma levels confirming the diagnosis of non-islet cell tumor induced hypoglycemia. The diagnosis is suggested by imaging but diagnostic confirmation is provided by the surgery, which remains the treatment of choice. Resection in many cases is the cure leading to hypoglycemia resolution. Recurrences and malignant transformations are possible which imposes a long-term monitoring. We report a case with relapsed malignant pleural fibrous tumor for which the pathophysiological mechanism of hypoglycemia could be documented as a paraneoplastic syndrome.",
    "[Reversible metalation of a bis-disulfide analogue of the Cys*-X-Cys* hepcidin binding site: structural characterisation of the related copper complex]. Hepcidin, a 25-amino-acid peptide secreted by the liver, distributed in the plasma and excreted in urine, is a key central regulator of body iron homeostasis. This hormone decreases export of cellular iron by binding to ferroportin, an iron exporter present at the basolateral surface of enterocytes and macrophages (the sites of dietary iron absorption and iron recycling, respectively), inducing its internalization and degradation. Hepcidin contains eight cysteine residues that form four disulfide bridges, which stabilize a hairpin-shaped structure with two beta sheets. We noticed in the sequence of hepcidin a Cys*-X-Cys* motif which can act as a metal binding site able to trap iron and/or copper. We have tested this hypothesis using a pseudopeptidic synthetic bis-disulfide analogue and we have shown that direct metalation of such ligand leads to the formation of a copper(III) complex with the typical N(2)S(2)\u00a0donor set. This compound crystallizes in the orthorhombic system, space group Imma. The Cu(III) configuration is square planar, built up from two carboximado-N and two thiolato-S donors. This complex is converted back to the bis-disulfide, with release of the copper salt, upon oxidation with iodine.",
    "chromDraw: an R package for visualization of linear and circular karyotypes. Species-specific sets of chromosomes-karyotypes-are traditionally depicted as linear ideograms with individual chromosomes represented by vertical bars. However, linear visualization has its limitations when the shared collinearity and/or chromosomal rearrangements differentiating two or more karyotypes need to be demonstrated. In these instances, circular visualization might provide easier comprehension and interpretation of inter-species chromosomal collinearity. The chromDraw graphical tool was developed as a user-friendly graphical tool for visualizing both linear and circular karyotypes based on the same input data matrix. The output graphics, saved in two different formats (EPS and SVG), can be easily imported to and modified in presentation and image-editing computer programs. The tool is freely distributed under GNU General Public License (GPL) and can be installed from Bioconductor or from the chromDraw home page.",
    "diffloop: a computational framework for identifying and analyzing differential DNA loops from sequencing data. Summary: The 3D architecture of DNA within the nucleus is a key determinant of interactions between genes, regulatory elements, and transcriptional machinery. As a result, differences in DNA looping structure are associated with variation in gene expression and cell state. To systematically assess changes in DNA looping architecture between samples, we introduce diffloop, an R/Bioconductor package that provides a suite of functions for the quality control, statistical testing, annotation, and visualization of DNA loops. We demonstrate this functionality by detecting differences between ENCODE ChIA-PET samples and relate looping to variability in epigenetic state. Availability and implementation: Diffloop is implemented as an R/Bioconductor package available at https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/diffloop.html.

    "dsPIG: a tool to predict imprinted genes from the deep sequencing of whole transcriptomes. BACKGROUND: Dysregulation of imprinted genes, which are expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner, plays an important role in various human diseases, such as cancer and behavioral disorder. To date, however, fewer than 100 imprinted genes have been identified in the human genome. The recent availability of high-throughput technology makes it possible to have large-scale prediction of imprinted genes. Here we propose a Bayesian model (dsPIG) to predict imprinted genes on the basis of allelic expression observed in mRNA-Seq data of independent human tissues. RESULTS: Our model (dsPIG) was capable of identifying imprinted genes with high sensitivity and specificity and a low false discovery rate when the number of sequenced tissue samples was fairly large, according to simulations. By applying dsPIG to the mRNA-Seq data, we predicted 94 imprinted genes in 20 cerebellum samples and 57 imprinted genes in 9 diverse tissue samples with expected low false discovery rates. We also assessed dsPIG using previously validated imprinted and non-imprinted genes. With simulations, we further analyzed how imbalanced allelic expression of non-imprinted genes or different minor allele frequencies affected the predictions of dsPIG. Interestingly, we found that, among biallelically expressed genes, at least 18 genes expressed significantly more transcripts from one allele than the other among different individuals and tissues. CONCLUSION: With the prevalence of the mRNA-Seq technology, dsPIG has become a useful tool for analysis of allelic expression and large-scale prediction of imprinted genes. For ease of use, we have set up a web service and also provided an R package for dsPIG at http://www.shoudanliang.com/dsPIG/.",
    "emMAW: computing minimal absent words in external memory. Motivation: The biological significance of minimal absent words has been investigated in genomes of organisms from all domains of life. For instance, three minimal absent words of the human genome were found in Ebola virus genomes. There exists an O(n) -time and O(n) -space algorithm for computing all minimal absent words of a sequence of length n on a fixed-sized alphabet based on suffix arrays. A standard implementation of this algorithm, when applied to a large sequence of length n , requires more than 20 n \u00a0bytes of RAM. Such memory requirements are a significant hurdle to the computation of minimal absent words in large datasets. Results: We present emMAW, the first external-memory algorithm for computing minimal absent words. A free open-source implementation of our algorithm is made available. This allows for computation of minimal absent words on far bigger data sets than was previously possible. Our implementation requires less than 3 h on a standard workstation to process the full human genome when as little as 1 GB of RAM is made available. We stress that our implementation, despite making use of external memory, is fast; indeed, even on relatively smaller datasets when enough RAM is available to hold all necessary data structures, it is less than two times slower than state-of-the-art internal-memory implementations.

    "iLIR database: A web resource for LIR motif-containing proteins in eukaryotes. Atg8-family proteins are the best-studied proteins of the core autophagic machinery. They are essential for the elongation and closure of the phagophore into a proper autophagosome. Moreover, Atg8-family proteins are associated with the phagophore from the initiation of the autophagic process to, or just prior to, the fusion between autophagosomes with lysosomes. In addition to their implication in autophagosome biogenesis, they are crucial for selective autophagy through their ability to interact with selective autophagy receptor proteins necessary for the specific targeting of substrates for autophagic degradation. In the past few years it has been revealed that Atg8-interacting proteins include not only receptors but also components of the core autophagic machinery, proteins associated with vesicles and their transport, and specific proteins that are selectively degraded by autophagy. Atg8-interacting proteins contain a short linear LC3-interacting region/LC3 recognition sequence/Atg8-interacting motif (LIR/LRS/AIM) motif which is responsible for their interaction with Atg8-family proteins. These proteins are referred to as LIR-containing proteins (LIRCPs). So far, many experimental efforts have been carried out to identify new LIRCPs, leading to the characterization of some of them in the past 10\u00a0years. Given the need for the identification of LIRCPs in various organisms, we developed the iLIR database ( https://ilir.warwick.ac.uk ) as a freely available web resource, listing all the putative canonical LIRCPs identified in silico in the proteomes of 8 model organisms using the iLIR server, combined with a Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis. Additionally, a curated text-mining analysis of the literature permitted us to identify novel putative LICRPs in mammals that have not previously been associated with autophagy.",
    "libFLASM: a software library for fixed-length approximate string matching. BACKGROUND: Approximate string matching is the problem of finding all factors of a given text that are at a distance at most k from a given pattern. Fixed-length approximate string matching is the problem of finding all factors of a text of length n that are at a distance at most k from any factor of length \u2113 of a pattern of length m. There exist bit-vector techniques to solve the fixed-length approximate string matching problem in time [Formula: see text] and space [Formula: see text] under the edit and Hamming distance models, where w is the size of the computer word; as such these techniques are independent of the distance threshold k or the alphabet size. Fixed-length approximate string matching is a generalisation of approximate string matching and, hence, has numerous direct applications in computational molecular biology and elsewhere. RESULTS: We present and make available libFLASM, a free open-source C++ software library for solving fixed-length approximate string matching under both the edit and the Hamming distance models. Moreover we describe how fixed-length approximate string matching is applied to solve real problems by incorporating libFLASM into established applications for multiple circular sequence alignment as well as single and structured motif extraction. Specifically, we describe how it can be used to improve the accuracy of multiple circular sequence alignment in terms of the inferred likelihood-based phylogenies; and we also describe how it is used to efficiently find motifs in molecular sequences representing regulatory or functional regions. The comparison of the performance of the library to other algorithms show how it is competitive, especially with increasing distance thresholds. CONCLUSIONS: Fixed-length approximate string matching is a generalisation of the classic approximate string matching problem. We present libFLASM, a free open-source C++ software library for solving fixed-length approximate string matching. The extensive experimental results presented here suggest that other applications could benefit from using libFLASM, and thus further maintenance and development of libFLASM is desirable.",
    "mDia1-3 in mammalian filopodia. mDia proteins are members of the formin family of actin nucleating proteins that polymerize linear actin filaments. Such filaments form the core of thin, tubular, membrane-bound cell surface protrusions known as filopodia, which are a major feature of mammalian cell morphology. Filopodia are dynamic structures that help cells sense environmental cues, and play a role in cell migration, axon guidance, angiogenesis and other processes. RhoGTPases bind to and control the activity of mDia proteins, and several other binding partners of the three mDia1 isoforms-mDia1, mDia2 and mDia3-have been documented. Two independent pathways controlling mammalian filopodium formation have emerged, with one driven by the RhoGTPase Cdc42, and the other by Rif. While mDia2 has been the main formin implicated in forming filopodia, mDia1 has recently surfaced as the key formin utilized by both the Cdc42 and Rif pathways to drive filopodial protrusion.",

    "mpMoRFsDB: a database of molecular recognition features in membrane proteins. SUMMARY: Molecular recognition features (MoRFs) are small, intrinsically disordered regions in proteins that undergo a disorder-to-order transition on binding to their partners. MoRFs are involved in protein-protein interactions and may function as the initial step in molecular recognition. The aim of this work was to collect, organize and store all membrane proteins that contain MoRFs. Membrane proteins constitute \u223c30% of fully sequenced proteomes and are responsible for a wide variety of cellular functions. MoRFs were classified according to their secondary structure, after interacting with their partners. We identified MoRFs in transmembrane and peripheral membrane proteins. The position of transmembrane protein MoRFs was determined in relation to a protein's topology. All information was stored in a publicly available mySQL database with a user-friendly web interface. A Jmol applet is integrated for visualization of the structures. mpMoRFsDB provides valuable information related to disorder-based protein-protein interactions in membrane proteins.

    "samExploreR: exploring reproducibility and robustness of RNA-seq results based on SAM files. MOTIVATION: Data from RNA-seq experiments provide us with many new possibilities to gain insights into biological and disease mechanisms of cellular functioning. However, the reproducibility and robustness of RNA-seq data analysis results is often unclear. This is in part attributed to the two counter acting goals of (i) a cost efficient and (ii) an optimal experimental design leading to a compromise, e.g. in the sequencing depth of experiments. RESULTS: We introduce an R package called samExploreR that allows the subsampling (m out of n bootstraping) of short-reads based on SAM files facilitating the investigation of sequencing depth related questions for the experimental design. Overall, this provides a systematic way for exploring the reproducibility and robustness of general RNA-seq studies.

    "\u03b3-Secretase modulator in Alzheimer's disease: shifting the end. The outcomes of the clinical trials of the \u03b3-secretase inhibitor Semagacestat (LY-450139) and the \u03b3-secretase modulator (GSM) Tarenflurbil were disappointing, but may not represent the end of the \u03b3-secretase era. \u03b3-Secretase modulators, by definition, only block the \u03b3-secretase cleavage of amyloid-\u03b2 protein precursor (A\u03b2PP) to generate the longer, 42-residue amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b242) without changing the production of total A\u03b2. The first generation GSMs were shown to block A\u03b242 generation while increasing A\u03b238. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, Tarenflurbil, binds to A\u03b2PP and shifts the cleavage site from A\u03b242 to A\u03b238. In addition, Tarenflurbil does not affect the \u03b3-secretase cleavage of Notch. Even before the failed clinical trials of Tarenflurbil, second generation GSMs had emerged, and some of these GSMs interact with presenilin, which carries the active site of the \u03b3-secretase. While second generation GSMs are pharmacologically superior to first generation GSMs, in vivo A\u03b2 profiles (decreased levels of A\u03b238, A\u03b240, and A\u03b242) in animals treated with potent GSMs are strikingly different from those in cultured cells. Thus, the unique pharmacologic properties of new GSMs and their mechanisms of action need to be elucidated in order to avoid the fate of Tarenflurbil. It is critical to understand how GSMs shift the \"end\" in vivo, i.e., shifting the \u03b3-secretase cleavage at the C-terminal end of A\u03b2. In view of the myriad effects of candidate GSMs on A\u03b2 production in cells and animals, drug development would benefit from better definition of the target-GSM interaction and physiological function of shorter A\u03b2 peptides."
